# Go-to-Market Strategy

KyanosTech’ go-to-market approach is designed to maximize adoption in a cyclical campaign market, balancing early credibility with scalable growth. The model prioritizes partnerships, high-impact races, and time-bound concessions to secure beachheads in 2026 and set up rapid expansion for 2028.

## Channel Strategy
- **Direct Engagement (25%)**: Reserved for top-tier campaigns where credibility is most valuable (early Senate, House, and gubernatorial campaigns).
- **Partnership Distribution (75%)**: Core strategy. Website developers, digital consultants, and PACs provide reach across hundreds of campaigns with far lower CAC.
- **Limited CMS Support**: Integration with **WordPress, NGP VAN, NationBuilder, and Run!** — the dominant CMS platforms used in Democratic campaigns. This ensures efficient adoption without custom connectors for every vendor.

**Responsibility:** GTM execution is led by the **Chief Commercial & Impact Officer**, responsible for PAC and union partnerships, CMS relationships (WordPress, NGP VAN, NationBuilder, Run!), and ensuring adoption translates directly into measurable Democratic impact.

## Foundational Relationship-Building (2025–2026)
- **2025 (Seed Phase)**:
  - No deployments in this year.
  - The Chief Commercial & Impact Officer takes direct responsibility for cultivating discreet relationships with PACs, unions, digital consultants, CMS vendors, and campaign managers.
  - Conduct assumption-testing interviews with 30–50 stakeholders to validate demand, adoption barriers, and pricing expectations.
  - Activities are kept deliberately below the radar — focused on listening, mapping networks, and preparing targeted entry in 2026, not public visibility.

- **2026 (First Pilots)**:
  - Leverage these early contacts to secure initial gubernatorial and competitive House campaigns.
  - Begin PAC co-funding discussions with organizations that supported interviews in 2025.
  - Offer deep discounts and manual services as a one-time credibility investment to secure flagship pilot accounts.

## 2026 — Early Validation & Concessions
- **Targets**: Competitive gubernatorial races (36 on the ballot; priority in battleground states), and a focused set of highly competitive or well-funded House races.
- **Tactics**:
  - Deep discounts and manual service support to secure credibility even where automation is incomplete.
  - PAC and Association Partnerships: Work with labor PACs (e.g., SEIU COPE) and membership PACs (e.g., EMILY’s List) to subsidize early campaigns.
- **Goal**: 10–15 marquee adoptions by cycle end; establish credibility, case studies, and reference customers.

## 2027 — Expansion & Officeholder Base
- **Targets**:
  - Growth in Senate campaigns entering early for 2028.
  - Expansion into House committees and officeholders, leveraging standardized CMS (.gov sites).
- **Tactics**:
  - Develop partner certification programs to enable scaled adoption.
  - Build early officeholder/committee revenue for recurring base.
  - Shift pricing closer to 2028 levels as features mature; reduce reliance on concessions.
- **Goal**: 40–50 active accounts (mix of campaigns + committees). Proof of scalability and partner-led growth.

## 2028 — Full-Scale Presidential & Federal Cycle
- **Targets**:
  - Presidential campaigns (primary and general).
  - All competitive Senate and governor races.
  - Around 30 competitive House races plus leadership/committee officeholders.
- **Tactics**:
  - National PAC/Union Partnerships: Integrate AI optimization funding into bundled candidate support packages.
  - Partner-Led Implementation: Majority of new campaigns acquired through certified consultants and developers.
  - Visibility Dashboarding: Deliver real-time campaign visibility benchmarks as a differentiator.
- **Goal**: 300+ campaigns and officeholders, demonstrating dominance of AI optimization for Democratic campaigns.

## Strategic Partnerships with Direct-Contribution Political Organizations
- **PAC-Driven Distribution**:
  - Labor unions (e.g., SEIU COPE) can bulk-fund optimization across dozens of candidates.
  - Professional PACs (e.g., EMILY’s List) can integrate our services into their candidate support offerings.
- **Proof of Value**: Success requires documenting how AI optimization improves campaign visibility and electoral outcomes, making it a natural addition to PAC-funded candidate packages.
- **Leverage Multiplier**: Each partnership can extend reach across dozens of campaigns, reducing CAC and embedding us in Democratic infrastructure.
