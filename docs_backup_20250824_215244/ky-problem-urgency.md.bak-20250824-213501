# Problem & Urgency

In 2024, Democrats underestimated the rise of podcasts as a persuasion medium. Conservative operatives and financiers systematically built an ecosystem of “low-trust but high-frequency” talk content that reached millions of voters week after week. Democrats were late to see this shift, and the asymmetry cost us narrative ground.

We now face a far more consequential inflection point: the rapid emergence of **AI chatbots and AI-assisted search as the default medium of political discovery**. These systems are no longer niche. They are already shaping how voters get answers to basic civic questions — and the pace of adoption is accelerating.

Voters’ “search” behavior is shifting from clicking links to receiving answers directly from AI systems. Independent tracking shows a material rise in “zero-click” behavior, where users get what they need without visiting a website. SparkToro’s 2024 analysis of Similarweb panel data found **58.5% of U.S. Google searches ended without a click**. Other trackers show lower but rising figures (e.g., **27.2% of U.S. Google searches zero-click as of March 2025**). Methodologies differ, but the trend is unmistakable: clicks are vanishing.

Google’s **AI Overviews** further compress clicks by answer-boxing results. In 2025, Pew’s field data observed that **a majority of users encountered at least one AI Overview in March 2025**, and multiple industry trackers now estimate Overviews appear on **roughly half of queries**.

We estimate that by the November 2028 general election, **~45–60% of voter information queries will be answered inside AI experiences (AI Overviews or chat) rather than via clicks to official or campaign sites**. Most users will never click a link, if one is even offered, and will be satisfied with what the chatbot says. The **mission of the candidate and officeholder website will be transformed**. It will be less and less a place that voters visit — and more and more the mechanism by which the chatbots are trained.
