# 3.  Solution & Theory of Change

## Framing the Shift
For decades, campaigns and journalists worried about “spin rooms” and “talk radio echo chambers.” By 2028, the battleground will be different: AI chatbots and answer engines will increasingly replace both news outlets and campaign websites as the place where voters first encounter political information. Voters will not visit dozens of sites — they will ask questions and expect the AI to answer in full.  

The mission of the candidate and officeholder website will be transformed. It will be less and less a place that voters visit, and more and more the mechanism by which the chatbots are trained. Campaign content must therefore be structured for AI discovery, not just human browsing.  

## Market Penetration of AI Answers
We estimate that by the November 2028 general election , **~45–60% of voter information queries will be answered inside AI experiences (AI Overviews or chat) rather than via clicks to official or campaign sites.** Most users will never click a link — if one is even offered — and will be satisfied with what the chatbot says.

## Zero-Click Behavior
Voters’ “search” behavior is shifting from clicking links to receiving answers directly from AI systems. Independent tracking shows a material rise in “zero-click” behavior, where users get what they need without visiting a website. SparkToro’s 2024 analysis of Similarweb panel data found **58.5% of U.S. Google searches ended without a click <sup class="fn-ref"><a href="../ky-appendix-footnotes-methodology/#fn-sol-sparktoro-zero-click-us-2024">1</a></sup>**; other panels show lower but rising figures (e.g., U.S. zero-click at **27.2% in March 2025 <sup class="fn-ref"><a href="../ky-appendix-footnotes-methodology/#fn-sol-zero-click-272-mar-2025">2</a></sup>**), underscoring different methodologies but the same directional trend.  

Google’s AI Overviews further compress clicks by answer-boxing results. In 2025, Pew’s field data observed that a **majority of users encountered at least one AI Overview <sup class="fn-ref"><a href="../ky-appendix-footnotes-methodology/#fn-sol-pew-58pct-ai-overview-exposure-2025">3</a></sup> in March**, and multiple industry trackers now estimate Overviews appear on roughly half of queries <sup class="fn-ref"><a href="../ky-appendix-footnotes-methodology/#fn-sol-aio-coverage-roughly-half-2025">4</a></sup>.

## Theory of Change
If Democrats fail to adapt, they risk invisibility  in the very medium where voters will be searching. Our theory of change is straightforward:   

1.  **Visibility:** Campaign and officeholder content must be structured in schema-compliant ways to be surfaced by AI.  
2.  **Credibility:** Narrative text and structured data must align, ensuring AI training engines recognize official sites as trusted sources.  
3. **Productivity:** Structured authoring processes streamline communications work and help staff detect inconsistencies across statements. <sup class="fn-ref"><a href="../ky-appendix-footnotes-methodology/#fn-sol-toc-step-3">5</a></sup>
4.  **Accountability:** Continuous monitoring and auditing  ensure that Democratic priorities are represented accurately in AI answers, while building the evidentiary base for addressing systemic bias.  

By 2028, this shift will determine whether Democrats  can compete effectively in the new information environment.
