# Market & Financial Opportunity

## 1. Urgency of Digital Discovery
## 2. Market Definition
We focus exclusively on **organic digital infrastructure**—CMS, analytics, structured-content platforms, compliance tooling—not paid media, travel, or administrative budgets.

### Market Funnel Overview

| Layer | Definition | 2026–28 Estimate | Notes / Sources |
|-------|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| **TAM** | Non-media digital/technology budgets of Democratic & Independent federal/state campaigns, committees, and officeholders | **$600–800 M** | Based on ~3–5% of campaign spend in budget line items like SaaS/CMS/content tools ([^fn-mo-total-political-12b-2024], [^fn-mo-method-1]). |
| **SAM** | Portion of TAM relevant to AI-discovery tools and structured data systems | **$20–40 M** | Leaning representation due to tool specificity and conservative assumption of allocation. |
| **SOM** | Attainable market via platform integration (limited CMS support + top-race targeting) | **$30–50 M** | Conservative penetration assumption aligned with early SaaS adoption trends. |

## 3. Growth Dynamics
- **Digital Dominance (Contextual Insight):** In late-cycle 2024, campaigns spent roughly **$23M on digital ads** vs. **$24.5M on TV ads**, showing near parity ([^fn-mo-method-1], [^fn-mo-digital-tv-parity]).  
- **Technology Budget Expansion:** Campaigns are increasingly investing in digital infrastructure (web platforms, analytics, structured data tools).  
- **Cyclical Uptake:** We expect SOM-driven ARR to peak in 2028, trough slightly in off-years, but remain supported through recurring officeholder/committee contracts, creating sustainable revenue flows across cycles.

[^fn-mo-method-1]: <strong>Ad Spend as Context—not Inclusion</strong> — Digital ad figures are used only to demonstrate the ongoing migration of campaign effort toward online voter reach and discovery; they are <em>not</em> included in TAM.

[^fn-mo-method-3]: <strong>Proportional Allocation (SAM)</strong> — Derived from TAM by limiting to structured data / AI-discovery tools; constrained by adoption readiness.

[^fn-mo-method-4]: <strong>SOM Penetration</strong> — Based on early SaaS adoption timelines and limited CMS integration, yielding ~$30–50M attainable market.

[^fn-mo-digital-tv-parity]: <strong>Late-cycle parity of digital vs. TV</strong> — <em>Wesleyan Media Project</em>, Release 10/31/24 (digital ≈ $23M vs. TV ≈ $24.5M in the period cited) <a href="https://mediaproject.wesleyan.edu/releases-103124/">link</a>.
