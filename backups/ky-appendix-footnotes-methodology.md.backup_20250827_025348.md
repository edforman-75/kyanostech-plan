**AI chatbots and AI-assisted search as the default medium of political discovery** — Pew Research and other surveys in 2025 highlighted the growing shift from traditional web search toward AI-powered results. (Provide exact source once finalized.)

**Validation plan for Solution & Theory estimates (2026–27)** — Placeholder. Will replace with a specific, citable study (e.g., AP–NORC/Morning Consult panel showing shift toward AI-mediated answers for political info).

**Key definitions, assumptions, and computations for Solution & Theory estimates** —  
- **AI Overviews coverage**: Projected share of search queries answered by AI-generated overviews, rising from ~50–55% in 2025 to 55–60% by 2028.  
- **AIO satisfaction rate**: Share of users who consider the overview answer sufficient (~60–70% for political queries, based on early user studies).  
- **Chatbot share of search events**: Queries initiated in conversational AI systems (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini), growing from ~5.6% desktop share in 2025 to ~15–20% by 2028.  
- **Computation (union probability)**: Let A = AIO_coverage × AIO_satisfaction; B = chatbot share.  
  - Base case: A = 0.58 × 0.65 ≈ 0.38; B = 0.18; assume 30% overlap → union ≈ 0.50 (50%).  
  - Range: With low/high bounds on AIO and chat growth plus overlap, we get ~45–60%.  
- **Validation**: This estimate will be tested with pilots in 2026–27 (see *Evidence & Methods*).

[^fn-sol-union-prob-2028]: <strong>Key definitions, assumptions, and computation for 2028 estimate</strong> — Let A = (<em>AI Overviews coverage</em> × <em>satisfaction</em>), B = <em>chat/chatbot share</em>. Union ≈ A + B − (A×B). Base case: 0.58×0.65 ≈ 0.38; B = 0.18; assume 30% overlap → ≈0.50 (50%). Range ≈45–60%. Validation planned in 2026–27.
