# 3.  Solution & Theory of Change

## Framing the Shift
For decades, campaigns and journalists worried about “spin rooms” and “talk radio echo chambers.” By 2028, the battleground will be different: AI chatbots and answer engines will increasingly replace both news outlets and campaign websites as the place where voters first encounter political information. Voters will not visit dozens of sites — they will ask questions and expect the AI to answer in full.  

The mission of the candidate and officeholder website will be transformed. It will be less and less a place that voters visit, and more and more the mechanism by which the chatbots are trained. Campaign content must therefore be structured for AI discovery, not just human browsing.  

## Market Penetration of AI Answers
We estimate that by the November 2028 general election [^sol-union-prob-2028] , **~45–60% of voter information queries will be answered inside AI experiences (AI Overviews or chat) rather than via clicks to official or campaign sites.** Most users will never click a link — if one is even offered — and will be satisfied with what the chatbot says.

## Zero-Click Behavior
Voters’ “search” behavior is shifting from clicking links to receiving answers directly from AI systems. Independent tracking shows a material rise in “zero-click” behavior, where users get what they need without visiting a website. SparkToro’s 2024 analysis of Similarweb panel data found **58.5% of U.S. Google searches ended without a click [^sol-sparktoro-zero-click-us-2024] **; other panels show lower but rising figures (e.g., U.S. zero-click at **27.2% in March 2025 [^sol-zero-click-272-mar-2025] **), underscoring different methodologies but the same directional trend.  

Google’s AI Overviews further compress clicks by answer-boxing results. In 2025, Pew’s field data observed that a **majority of users encountered at least one AI Overview [^sol-pew-58pct-ai-overview-exposure-2025]  in March**, and multiple industry trackers now estimate Overviews appear on roughly half of queries [^sol-aio-coverage-roughly-half-2025] .

## Theory of Change

If Democrats fail to adapt, they risk invisibility [^sol-invisibility-claim-2028] in the very medium where voters will be searching. Our theory of change is straightforward: [^sol-toc-overview]

1. **Visibility: [^sol-toc-step-1]** Campaign and officeholder content must be structured in schema-compliant ways (e.g., JSON-LD, schema.org) so it can be surfaced accurately by AI chatbots and answer engines.
2. **Credibility: [^sol-toc-step-2]** Narrative text and structured data must align, ensuring that AI training systems recognize official sources as trustworthy and consistent.
3. **Productivity: [^sol-toc-step-3]** Structured authoring processes streamline communications work, reducing duplication and helping staff detect inconsistencies across statements.
4. **Accountability: [^sol-toc-step-4]** Continuous monitoring and auditing [^sol-accountability-monitor-audit] ensures that Democratic priorities are represented accurately in AI answers while also building the evidentiary base for addressing systemic bias.

By 2028, this shift will determine whether Democrats [^sol-2028-competition-outcome] can compete effectively in the new information environment.
