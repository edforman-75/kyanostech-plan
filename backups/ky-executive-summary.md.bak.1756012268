# Executive Summary

Democrats face a structural, AI‑accelerated persuasion gap. The right is already testing and scaling synthetic media, micro‑targeted persuasion, and influencer pipelines across local news ecosystems, TikTok feeds, and creator networks. Waiting until 2026 to react would be a strategic error with compounding costs.

Our strategy focuses the next four years on one goal: measurable Democratic wins and better governance through targeted AI leverage. That requires a disciplined build‑out of three product lines — **AGON** (“Win the Contest”), **POLIS** (“Govern with Intelligence”), and **SCOPE** (“Measure What Matters”) — paired with a pragmatic go‑to‑market that meets campaigns where they already are.

This is not hypothetical: the right already enjoys early mover advantage. AI‑generated content is flooding local news ecosystems, TikTok feeds, and micro‑targeted ad channels. **Democrats cannot afford to wait — the contest is already underway.**

!!! danger "Two Scares, One Choice"
    **Scare #1:** A rapid surge of AI persuasion (hyper‑local synthetics, creator networks, automated micro‑targeting) is already shaping voter attention streams.
    
    **Scare #2:** A narrow 2026–2028 window in which persuasion tech and distribution outpace traditional organizing and media controls.

    **What must happen:** Democrats must urgently **fund this plan — or an equally robust alternative** — to stand up a defense and counter‑offense now. Hoping the threat subsides is not a strategy.

## The Four‑Year Ramp (2025–2028)

- **2025:** Quiet relationship‑building and assumption validation with PACs, unions, consultants, and CMS vendors; no public deployments.
- **2026:** Early pilots and targeted discounts or, if necessary, pro bono support — including manual execution where automation isn’t complete — to secure credibility with **gubernatorial and Congressional (House & Senate)** campaigns.
- **2027:** Expansion into Senate campaigns and institutional governance users; recurring base revenue begins via platform packaging and distribution partners.
- **2028:** Scaled dominance — 300+ campaigns served through PAC/consultant partnerships, visibility dashboards, and mature platform workflows.

## Go‑to‑Market (Built for Campaign Reality)

- **Channel Mix:** Direct (top‑tier races) + Partnerships (majority of volume via website developers, digital consultants, PACs).  
- **Where campaigns already live:** Targeted support for WordPress, NGP VAN, NationBuilder, and Run! to remove integration friction.  
- **Ownership:** The Chief Commercial & Impact Officer leads PAC/union relationships, consultant distribution, CMS alliances, and conversion from pilots to repeatable wins.

## What We’re Building (and Why It Wins)

- **AGON (“Win the Contest”):** Campaign‑side AI that turns content, testing, and distribution into compounding persuasion.  
- **POLIS (“Govern with Intelligence”):** Officeholder tools for constituent engagement and service that convert legitimacy into durable political capital.  
- **SCOPE (“Measure What Matters”):** Independent verification and lift measurement so spend moves toward what actually persuades — and away from vanity metrics.

## Proof, Not Promises

We will demonstrate value through: (1) controlled pilots with documented lift, (2) transparent dashboards for stakeholders, and (3) independent validation via SCOPE. Dollars follow evidence — and evidence will be made visible.

## What We Need

Time‑bound funding to execute the 2025–2026 credibility phase and lock in distribution for 2027–2028. The alternative is to concede the initiative while the other side compounds first‑mover advantage.

**Bottom line:** Fund the plan now. Build the defense and the counter‑offense. Win the contest — and govern with intelligence.
