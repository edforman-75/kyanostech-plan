# Market & Financial Opportunity

## 1. Urgency of Digital Discovery
By 2026–2028, it’s projected that **over half of all voter interactions**—from research to decision-making—will occur via **AI-mediated interfaces and structured discovery**, rather than traditional media. This behavioral shift is mirrored in campaign strategy: by August 2024, digital political ad spend had already reached **$619M**, with **$1.35B for the full cycle**, highlighting how campaigns are reallocating resources toward online channels to reach voters where discovery is increasingly taking place **and where voters look for further information**[^fn-mo-method-1].
- **Technology Budget Expansion:** Campaigns are increasingly investing in digital infrastructure (web platforms, analytics, structured data tools).  
- **Cyclical Uptake:** We expect SOM-driven ARR to peak in 2028, trough slightly in off-years, but remain supported through recurring officeholder/committee contracts, creating sustainable revenue flows across cycles.
