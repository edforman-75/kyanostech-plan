# Business Model & Unit Economics

We structure the business model using the Strategyzer Business Model Canvas (BMC)[^fn-bm-strategyzer].  
All elements below are initial assumptions; during the SEED phase, we will conduct further research, expert interviews, and partner validation to substantiate the model.

---

## 1. Customer Segments
- Democratic campaigns (Presidential, Senate, House).  
- Democratic committees (DNC, DSCC, DCCC, state parties).  
- Officeholder committees (incumbent Members of Congress).  
- Independent-aligned campaigns and committees (case-by-case).  

---

## 2. Value Propositions
- **Visibility in AI search:** Ensures Democratic facts, values, and positions are discoverable in AI assistants.  
- **Compliance & security:** Meets .gov and FEC requirements.  
- **Productivity:** Reduces staff time via structured authoring, grammar/style support.  
- **Accountability:** Continuous benchmarking/audit trail supports litigation, press, and public trust.  

---

## 3. Channels
- Direct sales to national committees and large campaigns.  
- Partnerships with Democratic digital agencies.  
- Limited CMS support (WordPress, Drupal/GovCMS) for distribution.  
- SEED phase pilots to build reference customers.  

---

## 4. Customer Relationships
- White-glove onboarding (early years).  
- Transition to scalable SaaS self-service by 2027–2028.  
- Ongoing customer success + training for campaign staff.  

---

## 5. Revenue Streams
- SaaS subscription tiers:  
  - **AGON** (campaign) – $1,500–$3,000/month depending on race size.  
  - **POLIS** (officeholder) – $1,000–$2,000/month.  
- Early services revenue (schema setup, training, audits).  
- Custom pilots (presidential campaigns, congressional committees).
