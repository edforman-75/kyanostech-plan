# Problem & Urgency

In 2024, Democrats underestimated the rise of podcasts as a persuasion medium. Conservative operatives and financiers systematically built an ecosystem of “low-trust but high-frequency” talk content that reached millions of voters week after week. Democrats were late to see this shift, and the asymmetry cost us narrative ground.

We now face a far more consequential inflection point: the rapid emergence of **AI chatbots and AI-assisted search as the default medium of political discovery**. These systems are no longer niche. They are already shaping how voters get answers to basic civic questions — and the pace of adoption is accelerating.

Voters’ “search” behavior is shifting from clicking links to receiving answers directly from AI systems. Search Engine Land reported that **27.2% of U.S. searches in March 2025 ended without a click, up from 24.4% the year before**.[^1]

Google’s **AI Overviews further compress clicks** by answer-boxing results. **Pew Research (July 2025) found that about 18% of all queries in March 2025 generated an AI Overview, while 60% of U.S. adults encountered at least one Overview during the month**. **Semrush’s July 2025 study reported a similar figure of 13.14% query coverage**.[^2][^3]

The trend is unmistakable: voters are increasingly satisfied with what the AI system says, never clicking through to official or campaign websites. The traditional model of persuasion through web links is eroding, while AI answer surfaces are becoming the new battleground.

We estimate that by the November 2028 general election, **~45–60% of voter information queries will be answered inside AI experiences (AI Overviews or chat) rather than via clicks to official or campaign sites**. Most users will never click a link, if one is even offered, and will be satisfied with what the chatbot says. The **mission of the candidate and officeholder website will be transformed**. It will be less and less a place that voters visit — and more and more the mechanism by which the chatbots are trained.
