# Executive Summary

Democrats face an **AI information crisis**. Conservative actors are investing heavily in automated propaganda while Democrats lack the infrastructure, standards, and tools to compete at scale. Without urgent intervention, the **2028 elections risk being fought on terrain already tilted by asymmetric AI advantage**.  

**KyanosTech** exists to correct this imbalance. We build platforms — **AGON**, **POLIS**, and **SCOPE** — designed to give Democratic campaigns, PACs, and civic allies the ability to:  

- **Create and distribute trustworthy content at scale** while meeting schema standards.  
- **Engage voters with intelligence and transparency** rather than manipulation.  
- **Verify and measure AI outputs** against democratic values, so that trust and accuracy become strategic assets.  

This is not hypothetical: the right already enjoys early mover advantage. AI-generated content is flooding local news ecosystems, TikTok feeds, and micro-targeted ad channels. Democrats cannot afford to wait — the contest is already underway.  

KyanosTech’s theory of change is built on a **four-year ramp to 2028 dominance**:  

- **2025**: Relationship-building and validation of assumptions, deliberately below the radar.  
- **2026**: Early pilots with marquee congressional and gubernatorial campaigns, offering **deep discounts, pro bono work, and manual effort where needed** to establish credibility and secure flagship accounts even if automation is not yet complete.  
- **2027**: Expansion into Senate campaigns, PAC dashboards, and institutional adoption.  
- **2028**: Scaled dominance — 300+ campaigns served, schema standards enforced, and Democratic infrastructure that endures beyond a single cycle.  

Our approach combines **product-led growth** with **partnership distribution**. Direct engagement builds credibility with marquee campaigns, while unions, PACs, and digital consultants extend reach into hundreds of down-ballot races.  

The goal is not just to win elections, but to establish **a durable Democratic AI infrastructure** — one that measures quality, enforces transparency, and secures long-term resilience against disinformation.  

**Investors and partners are invited to join in now**, when strategic capital and guidance can still shape the outcome. By 2028, the window for intervention will have closed.
