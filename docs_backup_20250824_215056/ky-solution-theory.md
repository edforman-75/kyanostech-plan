# 3. Solution & Theory of Change

## Framing the Shift
For decades, campaigns and journalists worried about “spin rooms” and “talk radio echo chambers.” By 2028, the battleground will be different: AI chatbots and answer engines will increasingly replace both news outlets and campaign websites as the primary source of political information for voters. Voters will not visit dozens of sites — they will ask questions and expect the AI to answer in full.  

The mission of the candidate and officeholder website will be transformed. It will be less and less a place that voters visit, and more and more the mechanism by which the chatbots are trained. Campaign content must therefore be structured for AI discovery, not just human browsing.  

## Market Penetration of AI Answers
We estimate that by the November 2028 general election, **~45–60% of voter information queries will be answered inside AI experiences (AI Overviews or chat) rather than via clicks to official or campaign sites.** Most users will never click a link — if one is even offered — and will be satisfied with what the chatbot says.  

**Key definitions and assumptions (conservative, documented):**  
- **AI Overviews coverage**: The share of search queries where Google or another major engine inserts an AI-generated overview. Projected to rise from ~50–55% in 2025 to 55–60% by 2028.  
- **AIO satisfaction rate**: The proportion of users who encounter an AI Overview and find the provided answer sufficient, so they do not click through to another source. Estimated at ~60–70% for political information queries, based on early user studies and behavioral panels.  
- **Chatbot share of search events (cross-device)**: Share of queries initiated directly in conversational AI systems such as ChatGPT or Gemini. Projected to grow from ~5.6% desktop browser share in 2025 to ~15–20% by 2028.  

**Computation (union probability, accounting for overlap):**  
Let A = AIO_coverage × AIO_satisfaction; B = chatbot share.  
- Base case: A = 0.58 × 0.65 ≈ 0.38; B = 0.18; assume 30% overlap → union ≈ 0.50 (50%).  
- Range: With low/high bounds on AIO and chat growth plus overlap, we get ~45–60%.  

This estimate will be validated with direct pilot testing in 2026–27 (see *Evidence & Methods*).【^1】

## Zero-Click Behavior
Voters’ “search” behavior is shifting from clicking links to receiving answers directly from AI systems. Independent tracking shows a material rise in “zero-click” behavior, where users get what they need without visiting a website. SparkToro’s 2024 analysis of Similarweb panel data found **58.5% of U.S. Google searches ended without a click**; other panels show lower but rising figures (e.g., U.S. zero-click at **27.2% in March 2025**), underscoring different methodologies but the same directional trend.【^2】【^3】  

Google’s AI Overviews further compress clicks by answer-boxing results. In 2025, Pew’s field data observed that a **majority of users encountered at least one AI Overview in March**, and multiple industry trackers now estimate Overviews appear on roughly half of queries.【^4】

## Theory of Change
If Democrats fail to adapt, they risk invisibility in the very medium where voters will be searching. Our theory of change is straightforward:  

1. **Visibility:** Campaign and officeholder content must be structured in schema-compliant ways to be surfaced by AI.  
2. **Credibility:** Narrative text and structured data must align, ensuring AI training engines recognize official sites as trusted sources.  
3. **Productivity:** Structured authoring processes streamline communications work and help staff detect inconsistencies across statements.  
4. **Accountability:** Continuous monitoring and auditing ensure that Democratic priorities are represented accurately in AI answers, while building the evidentiary base for addressing systemic bias.  

By 2028, this shift will determine whether Democrats can compete effectively in the new information environment.
