## Impact Measurement & Reporting

KyanosTech will not be judged solely on revenues, but on mission impact: improving the visibility, accuracy, and competitiveness of Democratic campaign and officeholder content in AI-mediated discovery. To ensure transparency and accountability, we will publish clear, consistent, and timely metrics for investors, partners, and campaigns.

### 1. Campaigns Served
Baseline: 0 in 2025.  
Goal: 300 campaigns by 2028 (mix of federal campaigns, congressional committees, and officeholders).  
Metric: Count of unique campaigns adopting one or more of AGON, POLIS, or SCOPE.  
Frequency: Tracked continuously; reported quarterly.

### 2. Quality Improvement Index (QII)
QII measures whether campaign and officeholder content is discoverable, accurate, and consistent in AI-mediated voter information results. Unlike legacy SEO scores, QII focuses on structured data, narrative clarity, and schema compliance.

- **Feasibility:**  
  Algorithmic scoring is validated by multiple precedents:
  * Google Rich Results / Schema.org Validators prove that schema compliance can be automatically assessed[^1].  
  * SEO scoring frameworks (Moz, SEMrush, BrightEdge) show that campaigns are already comfortable using automated quality metrics[^2].  
  * AI readability research demonstrates that structured, simplified text improves AI-driven summaries[^3].  
  * University of Washington (Pezzuti et al., 2025) developed neural quality estimation models that algorithmically assess semantic quality of web content[^4].  

- **Comfort & Adoption:**  
  Campaigns are already accustomed to SEO scores (less sophisticated than QII), ensuring adoption will not feel foreign.  

- **Methodology:**  
  QII will be constructed algorithmically, with human audit trails only as a backup. Scores will update continuously, with campaigns able to access on-demand dashboards.

### 3. Replaced Media Spend
Metric: Percentage of campaign media/consulting dollars replaced by structured AI-ready content.  
Rationale: Demonstrates ROI by showing KyanosTech tools substitute for traditional expenditures.  
Validation: Benchmarked against historical media spend and tested via early pilots.

### 4. Dashboards & Transparency
Campaigns and investors will have access to near-real-time dashboards. These dashboards will:
- Show campaign-level QII scores, changes over time, and benchmarks against peers.  
- Provide transparency into adoption progress and the direct impact of structured data.  
- Be exportable for investor and board reporting.  

This transparency ensures accountability not only to investors, but to the mission of improving Democratic visibility in AI information channels.

## Footnotes: Precedents for Algorithmic Quality Scoring

[^1]: **Google Rich Results / Schema.org Validators** – demonstrate feasibility of automated schema testing. See Google Developers: [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results).  
[^2]: **SEO Scoring Frameworks** – Moz, SEMrush, and BrightEdge all provide algorithmic scoring widely accepted by campaigns as proxies for digital strength. For example: [Moz Domain Authority](https://moz.com/learn/seo/domain-authority).  
[^3]: **AI Readability Research** – Studies show that structured, simplified text improves inclusion in AI-driven summaries. See Dellerman et al., *AI-Based Readability Metrics for Digital Content* (2023).  
[^4]: **University of Washington (Pezzuti et al., 2025)** – Developed **neural quality estimation models** for web content that algorithmically assess semantic quality. This validates the feasibility of QII as an algorithmic rather than manual measure.

Cross-Reference Map: Impact Measurement & Reporting

Internal Cross-References
1. Financial Plan  
   - “Capital efficiency ratios” and CAC/LTV tie directly to Financial Plan (Investor Metrics subsection).  
   - Low/base/high case sensitivity analysis connects to QII improvements as justification for campaign ROI.  
   - Anchor target: #financial-plan  

2. Products (AGON, POLIS, SCOPE)  
   - QII feeds back into Product Strategy & Technology, particularly SCOPE’s audit trail and continuous learning loop.  
   - Mention dashboards and reporting that campaigns expect alongside product outputs.  
   - Anchor target: #product-strategy--technology  

3. Exit & Legacy  
   - QII and replaced media spend metrics form part of long-term impact accountability for investors/donors.  
   - Supports “responsible legacy” narrative by ensuring KyanosTech is measurable and transparent.  
   - Anchor target: #exit--legacy  

4. Go-to-Market Strategy  
   - Continuous reporting and dashboards become part of GTM proof points (demos, PAC partnership reporting).  
   - Anchor target: #go-to-market-strategy
