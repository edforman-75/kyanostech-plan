## Methodology Notes

**Assumptions for the 45–60% union estimate (2028):**
- AI Overviews (AIO) coverage grows from ~50–55% (2025) to ~55–60% (2028).  
- Satisfied no‑click rate on AIO/pages ~60–70%.  
- Chatbot share of “search‑like” sessions grows from ~5–6% (2025 desktop; higher mobile) to ~15–20% (2028).  
- Overlap adjustment between AIO and chat experiences ≈ 30%.

**Computation sketch:**  
Let A = (AIO coverage × satisfaction) ≈ 0.58 × 0.65 ≈ 0.38.  
Let B = (chat/assistant share that resolves without site click) ≈ 0.18.  
Union ≈ A + B − (overlap) ≈ 0.38 + 0.18 − 0.06 ≈ 0.50 → **~50%**, with plausible range **45–60%** given assumptions.
