# Business Model & Unit Economics

We structure the business model using the Strategyzer Business Model Canvas (BMC)[^fn-bm-strategyzer]. All elements below are initial assumptions; during the SEED phase, we will conduct further research, expert interviews, and partner validation to substantiate the model.

---

## 1. Customer Segments
- Democratic campaigns (Presidential, Senate, House).
- Democratic committees (DNC, DSCC, DCCC, state parties).
- Officeholder committees (incumbent Members of Congress).
- Independent-aligned campaigns and committees (case-by-case).

---

## 2. Value Propositions
- **Visibility in AI search:** Ensures Democratic facts, values, and positions are discoverable in AI assistants.
- **Compliance & security:** Meets .gov and FEC requirements.
- **Productivity:** Reduces staff time via structured authoring, grammar/style support.
- **Accountability:** Continuous benchmarking/audit trail supports litigation, press, and public trust.

---

## 3. Channels
- Direct sales to national committees and large campaigns.
- Partnerships with Democratic digital agencies.
- Limited CMS support (WordPress, Drupal/GovCMS) for distribution.
See Appendix E: CMS Landscape Briefing for detail on CMS platforms and their role in campaign infrastructure.
- SEED phase pilots to build reference customers.

---

## 4. Customer Relationships
- White-glove onboarding (early years).
- Transition to scalable SaaS self-service by 2027–2028.
- Ongoing customer success + training for campaign staff.

---

## 5. Revenue Streams
- SaaS subscription tiers:
  - **AGON** (campaign) – $1,500–$3,000/month depending on race size.
  - **POLIS** (officeholder) – $1,000–$2,000/month.
- Early services revenue (schema setup, training, audits).
- Custom pilots (presidential campaigns, congressional committees).

---

## 6. Key Resources
- Proprietary schema library and AI benchmarking system.
- Engineering team (schema, AI/ML, integrations).
- Policy/legal advisors for compliance.
- Partnerships with campaign committees and agencies.

---

## 7. Key Activities
- Continuous schema development and updates.
- Benchmark testing and reporting.
- Customer onboarding + training.
- Security and compliance audits.

---

## 8. Key Partnerships
- Democratic committees (DNC, DSCC, DCCC).
- Academic institutions (methodology, bias research).
- Agencies providing campaign digital services.
- CMS providers (WordPress, Drupal/GovCMS).

---

## 9. Cost Structure
- Heavy R&D in early years (schema, SCOPE platform, AI testing).
- Services staff (onboarding, setup) in 2025–2026.
- Transition to SaaS-dominant margins (>70%) by 2028.[^fn-bm-margins-2028]
- Estimated ARR by 2028: **~$4.2M**, with durable SaaS retention.[^fn-bm-arr-2028]

Given significant operating, product development, and customer acquisition costs, achieving cash-flow break-even in 2028 depends on hitting both our revenue targets and our gross-margin goals.

[^fn-bm-margins-2028]: **SaaS Gross Margin Benchmarks:** Mature B2B SaaS companies achieve 70-85% gross margins by $1-10M ARR scale. [KeyBanc Capital Markets "2024 SaaS Survey"](https://www.keybanccapitalmarkets.com/2024-saas-survey/) reports 73% average gross margins for companies >$5M revenue; [Bessemer Venture Partners "State of the Cloud 2024"](https://www.bvp.com/atlas/state-of-the-cloud-2024) shows top quartile SaaS companies achieve 80-85% gross margins at $1-10M ARR; [Chargebee SaaS Gross Margin Guide](https://www.chargebee.com/resources/glossaries/saas-gross-margin/) validates 75%+ margins as achievable for mature SaaS products with strong product-market fit.

[^fn-bm-arr-2028]: **ARR Growth and Expansion Revenue:** ARR estimate (~$4.2M by 2028) derived from AGON $1.5–3.0k/mo and POLIS $1.0–2.0k/mo pricing multiplied by expected account counts and ramp; see Appendix A model for assumptions and scenario ranges. Strong SaaS businesses derive 20-40% of ARR growth from existing customer expansion. [ProfitWell (now Paddle) "SaaS Metrics That Matter"](https://www.paddle.com/resources/saas-metrics) shows median net revenue retention of 108%; [ChartIO SaaS Metrics Guide](https://chartio.com/learn/product-analytics/what-is-net-revenue-retention/) indicates expansion revenue typically represents 25-35% of total ARR growth for mature SaaS platforms.
