!!! note "The AI Abstention Trap"

**The Risk**: Progressive campaigns avoiding AI face systematic disadvantage against opponents using these technologies strategically.

**The Reality**: 800 million users rely on ChatGPT weekly while 61% distrust AI â€” yet usage accelerates across all demographics (Appendix [X]).

**The Consequence**: As 34% of Americans use AI for research, campaigns abstaining from optimization lose control over candidate representation in AI responses.

**The Urgency**: With AI chatbots shifting political views in just five interactions, progressive campaigns must engage strategically or let conservatives dominate AI information space.

**Bottom Line**: Ideological AI purity creates tactical blindness that risks Democratic losses when others shape AI-mediated political reality unchallenged.
