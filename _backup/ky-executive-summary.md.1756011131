# Executive Summary

**KyanosTech — Blue Technology for Democratic Victory**

KyanosTech builds applied-AI platforms that help Democratic campaigns win elections, govern effectively, and prove impact. Our suite—**AGON** (“Win the Contest”), **POLIS** (“Govern with Intelligence”), and **SCOPE** (“Measure What Matters”)—combines modern data infrastructure, responsible AI, and practical workflows to raise persuasion, turnout, constituent satisfaction, and program ROI.

## Problem & Urgency
Campaigns and civic offices are drowning in fragmented tools, unreliable data, and staff constraints. Meanwhile, persuasion channels have shifted to high-velocity, AI-shaped media. Democratic operations need faster insight, safer automation, and rigorous measurement to compete and govern. See: [Problem & Urgency](ky-problem-urgency.md).

## Our Solution & Theory of Change
KyanosTech delivers a unified, privacy‑respecting AI stack across the campaign‑to‑governance lifecycle:

- **AGON Campaign Platform** — targeting, creative generation, message testing, field optimization, and fundraising intelligence in one workflow. (“Win the contest.”) See: [Solution & Theory of Change](ky-solution-theory.md) and [Product Strategy & Technology](ky-products-tech.md).
- **POLIS Governance Platform** — constituent services triage, policy insight routing, engagement analytics, and service‑level management for offices and agencies. (“Govern with intelligence.”)
- **SCOPE Verification Platform** — independent, ongoing evaluation for models, media, and programs; bias/efficacy checks, uplift measurement, and audit‑ready reporting. (“Measure what matters.”) See: [Impact Measurement & Reporting](ky-impact-measurement.md).

Together, these systems shorten the cycle from data → decision → action and lift outcomes while enforcing safety, transparency, and compliance.

## Product Strategy & Technology
- **Data Foundation**: consented voter, donor, and constituent data pipelines; strong PII handling; secure enclaves; governance by design.
- **Models**: ensemble LLMs with policy/guardrail layers; retrieval and fine‑tuning for political and constituent domains; red‑team and eval harnesses run by **SCOPE**.
- **Workflows**: role‑based UX for digital, field, comms, research, casework, and policy teams; API‑first integrations with CRM, dialers, CMS, ad-tech, and commerce.
- **Safety & Compliance**: content policies, watermarking/attribution, rate‑limiting, and logged decisions to enable audits and FEC/agency compliance. See: [Product Strategy & Technology](ky-products-tech.md).

## Market & Financial Opportunity
- Addressable spend across Democratic federal, state, and local cycles; year‑round expansion in governance and advocacy.
- Buyers: campaigns, committees, allied orgs, elected offices, and agencies.
- Dual‑engine revenue: subscription + usage; professional services only where they accelerate adoption. See: [Market & Financial Opportunity](ky-market-opportunity.md) and [Business Model](ky-business-model.md).

## Go-To-Market
- Land with AGON in competitive races; expand to POLIS post‑win for continuity; embed SCOPE for proof and accountability.
- Channel partners: data vendors, agencies, consulting firms, state parties.
- Training & enablement for digital/field/program leads; certification for partner network. See: [Go-To-Market](ky-go-to-market.md).

## Impact Measurement & Reporting
- **SCOPE** quantifies uplift, bias, and safety continuously across media, field, and service workflows.
- Standard dashboards: persuasion/turnout lift, case resolution SLAs, satisfaction, equity, and budget efficiency—exportable for compliance and funder reporting. See: [Impact Measurement & Reporting](ky-impact-measurement.md) and supporting evidence in [Appendix D](ky-appendix-d-evidence.md).

## Execution Plan
- **Year 1**: AGON GA for priority states; SCOPE eval suite v1; POLIS pilots in two offices.
- **Year 2–3**: multi‑state expansion; POLIS GA; deeper ad‑tech/CRM integrations; third‑party certification for SCOPE.
- **Year 4**: full-cycle coverage; measurable lift across persuasion, turnout, and constituent outcomes. See: [Team & Governance](ky-team-governance.md) and [Risk & Mitigation](ky-risk-mitigation.md).

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Data/Model Risk**: hardened governance, red‑teaming, and SCOPE audits.
- **Adoption Risk**: role‑based UX, templated playbooks, partner enablement.
- **Regulatory/Compliance**: proactive policy alignment; audit logs; exportable reports. See: [Risk & Mitigation](ky-risk-mitigation.md).

## What We’re Building
- **AGON** — Where campaign strategy meets AI intelligence. Win the contest.  
- **POLIS** — Intelligent governance for Democratic leaders. Serve people better.  
- **SCOPE** — Intelligent measurement for AI optimization. Prove your impact.  

KyanosTech delivers blue technology for Democratic victory—before, during, and after Election Day.
