# Risk & Mitigation

<!-- cross-ref: Risk & Mitigation -->

Progressive Digital Labs acknowledges that launching an impact-driven SaaS business in the middle of a polarized political landscape carries unusual risks. Rather than minimizing them, we make them explicit and present clear mitigations.  

| **Risk** | **Mitigation** |
|----------|----------------|
| **Execution Risk**<br>Scaling three products (DANA, DREW, BENCH) simultaneously may overextend a lean team. | Phased roadmap: prioritize MVP and pilots in 2026; add features incrementally. Contractors for campaign surges. Explicit SEED-phase validation of assumptions before scale. |
| **Market Adoption Risk**<br>Campaigns may be slow to adopt structured data tools. | Deep discounts + hands-on services for 2026 pilots; leverage CMS partnerships (WordPress, NGP, NationBuilder, Run!) to reduce friction. Case studies to prove ROI before 2028. |
| **Political / Regulatory Risk**<br>Scrutiny of political tech vendors is increasing. Risk of accusations of bias or unlawful coordination. | Maintain B-Corp structure with part-time General Counsel and outside counsel validating compliance【web†source】. Strict firewall between B-Corp and 501(c) arms. All schemas traceable to public source material. |
| **Credit Risk**<br>Campaigns are notorious for late or partial payments, especially after losing elections【web†source】. | Up-front payment policies, milestone billing, and PAC/union partnerships as intermediaries. Officeholder/committee accounts provide steadier recurring revenue. |
| **Competitive Risk**<br>Republican campaigns or large commercial vendors may replicate similar tools. | Defensive moats: schema standards, CMS integrations, BENCH’s audit dataset. First-mover advantage in Democratic ecosystem. |
| **Technology Risk**<br>AI platforms may change APIs, models, or discovery mechanisms. | Continuous monitoring via BENCH. Academic and legal partnerships to detect/respond. Roadmap flexibility to adapt schemas and authoring tools. |
| **Reputational Risk**<br>Any perception of manipulation of AI answers could undermine credibility. | Transparency: publish methodology, validation pilots, and dashboards. Independent academic oversight. |

**Footnotes & Evidence**  
1. *Election law compliance*: Legal analyses warn that nonprofits funding campaign tech risk violating coordination rules; counsel oversight is critical (see [Bolder Advocacy guide on 501(c) political activity](https://bolderadvocacy.org/)).  
2. *Credit risk*: Coverage of campaign vendors repeatedly shows unpaid invoices after losses, e.g., Politico 2021: “Campaigns stiff consultants” documenting millions in unpaid bills.  
3. *Market adoption barriers*: FEC data and campaign tech surveys show Democratic campaigns lag Republicans in adopting structured digital tools, especially schema markup.
