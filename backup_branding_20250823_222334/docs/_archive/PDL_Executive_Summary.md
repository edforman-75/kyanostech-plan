## The Four-Year Ramp (2025–2028)
- **2025**: Quiet relationship-building and assumption validation.
- **2026**: Early concessions, credibility pilots, and case studies with gubernatorial and House races.
- **2027**: Expansion into Senate campaigns and officeholders/committees; recurring base revenue begins.
- **2028**: Scaled dominance — 300+ campaigns served via PAC/consultant partnerships, visibility dashboards, and platform maturity.
