# Financial Plan

Progressive Digital Labs’ financial strategy balances realism with ambition. We recognize the highly cyclical nature of political campaign revenues and the unique requirements of Democratic-aligned organizations. This section integrates projected revenues, expense assumptions, sensitivity analysis, and investor-oriented metrics to provide a comprehensive picture of financial sustainability.

## Revenue Model

Revenues begin in **2026**. The year **2025 is purely a SEED stage year**, dedicated to validating market assumptions, building prototypes, forming partnerships, and refining the technology. No deployments or billings occur in 2025.

By 2026, early revenues are expected from **Senate, House, gubernatorial, and presidential campaigns** piloting our AI visibility and structured discovery tools. Committees and officeholders enter later, providing a longer tail of recurring revenue between election cycles. Revenues rise through 2028 as adoption grows and structured visibility becomes indispensable to competitive campaigns.

## Sensitivity Analysis

Because campaign revenues are highly cyclical, we present scenarios for **low, base, and high adoption** by 2028. These scenarios reflect differing assumptions about the number of campaigns onboarded and average spend per campaign.

### Revenue and Expense Scenarios (2028)

| Category             | Low Case ($M) | % Rev | Base Case ($M) | % Rev | High Case ($M) | % Rev |
|----------------------|---------------|-------|----------------|-------|----------------|-------|
| **Revenues**         | 2.5           | 100%  | 4.2            | 100%  | 6.5            | 100%  |
| **Expenses**         |               |       |                |       |                |       |
| R&D                  | 1.2           | 48%   | 1.5            | 36%   | 1.8            | 28%   |
| Compliance & Legal   | 0.4           | 16%   | 0.5            | 12%   | 0.6            | 9%    |
| Go-to-Market         | 0.9           | 36%   | 1.2            | 29%   | 1.6            | 25%   |
| Infrastructure       | 0.4           | 16%   | 0.5            | 12%   | 0.6            | 9%    |
| **Total Expenses**   | 2.9           | 116%  | 3.7            | 88%   | 4.6            | 71%   |
| **Cash Flow**        | -0.4          | -16%  | +0.5           | 12%   | +1.9           | 29%   |

*Methodology:* Campaign counts × ARPU drive revenue assumptions. Expense categories scale with adoption. Percentages reflect expenses relative to revenue.

## CAC and LTV Analysis

Our financial model incorporates SaaS-standard efficiency metrics.  

- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):** Includes sales, marketing, support, and onboarding, divided by the number of new campaigns in a year.  
- **LTV (Lifetime Value):** Average annual account value × expected duration (1–2 years for campaigns, longer for committees and officeholders).  

### Efficiency Ratios (Base Case)

| Metric       | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 |
|--------------|------|------|------|
| CAC ($K)     | 22   | 18   | 15   |
| LTV ($K)     | 55   | 65   | 80   |
| CAC / LTV    | 0.40 | 0.28 | 0.19 |

*Interpretation:* Even under conservative assumptions, CAC/LTV remains within investor-acceptable SaaS ranges. By 2028, strong leverage emerges from lower CAC per campaign as reputation and distribution partnerships improve.

## Funding Plan

We plan to raise **$5M total capital** through a staged approach:  

- **Seed (2025):** $0.5M to validate assumptions, build prototype, establish partnerships.  
- **Series A (2026):** $2.5M to fund first campaign deployments, expand R&D and GTM.  
- **Convertible Debt (2027):** $2.0M to provide runway and flexibility ahead of scaling in 2028.  

This financing ensures sufficient runway to reach **neutral cash flow in 2028**, even under conservative adoption.

---

## Sensitivity Interpretation

- **Low Case (2.5M revenue):** Cash flow is negative (-$0.4M). Management would reduce expenses, particularly discretionary GTM spend, and extend partnerships to bridge the gap. Additional capital may be considered.  
- **Base Case (4.2M revenue):** Cash flow positive (+$0.5M). Validates sustainability at moderate adoption.  
- **High Case (6.5M revenue):** Strong positive cash flow (+$1.9M). Resources would be reinvested in technology, partnerships, and resilience to lock in durable advantage.

## Cross-References

- **Business Model (BMC):** For value propositions, distribution, and customer segments.  
- **Investment Ask:** For detailed use of funds and exit pathways.  
- **Risk & Mitigation:** For downside scenarios tied to adoption rates.
