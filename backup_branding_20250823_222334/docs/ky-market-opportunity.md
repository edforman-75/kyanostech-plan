# Market & Financial Opportunity

## 1. Urgency of Digital Discovery
By 2026–2028, it’s projected that **over half of all voter interactions**—from research to decision-making—will occur via **AI-mediated interfaces and structured discovery**, rather than traditional media. For example, political ad spending on digital platforms alone **surged to $619 million by August 2024**, with total online ad spend reaching **$1.35 billion for the full cycle** ([brennancenter.org](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/online-ad-spending-2024-election-topped-135-billion)).

## 2. Market Definition
We focus exclusively on **organic digital infrastructure**—CMS, analytics, structured-content platforms, compliance tooling—not paid media, travel, or administrative budgets.

### Market Funnel Overview

| Layer | Definition | 2026–28 Estimate | Notes / Sources |
|-------|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| **TAM** | Non-media digital/technology budgets of Democratic & Independent federal/state campaigns, committees, and officeholders | **$600–800 M** | Based on ~3–5% of campaign spend in budget line items like SaaS/CMS/content tools ([emarketer.com](https://www.emarketer.com/press-releases/2024-political-ad-spending-will-jump-nearly-30-vs-2020), [brennancenter.org](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/online-political-spending-2024)). |
| **SAM** | Portion of TAM relevant to AI-discovery tools and structured data systems | **$20–40 M** | Leaning representation due to tool specificity and conservative assumption of allocation. |
| **SOM** | Attainable market via platform integration (limited CMS support + top-race targeting) | **$30–50 M** | Conservative penetration assumption aligned with early SaaS adoption trends. |

## 3. Growth Dynamics
- **Digital Dominance (Contextual Insight):** In late-cycle 2024, campaigns spent roughly **$23M on digital ads** vs. **$24.5M on TV ads**, showing near parity ([brennancenter.org](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/online-political-spending-2024), [mediaproject.wesleyan.edu](https://mediaproject.wesleyan.edu/releases-103124/)).  
- **Technology Budget Expansion:** Campaigns are increasingly investing in digital infrastructure (web platforms, analytics, structured data tools).  
- **Cyclical Uptake:** We expect SOM-driven ARR to peak in 2028, trough slightly in off-years, but remain supported through recurring officeholder/committee contracts, creating sustainable revenue flows across cycles.

## Methodology Notes
1. **Ad Spend as Context—not Inclusion**: Digital ad figures are used solely to demonstrate voter behavior shifts, not to inflate TAM.  
2. **Digital-Tech Share Benchmark (TAM)**: Industry reporting shows total political advertising will exceed $12B in 2024, with digital media accounting for ~28% of that. We use conservative 3–5% estimate for non-media digital infrastructure.  
3. **Proportional Allocation (SAM)**: SAM is derived conservatively from TAM, factoring in tool specificity and practical adoption constraints.  
4. **SOM Penetration**: Based on early-stage SaaS adoption timelines and limited CMS integration paths.
