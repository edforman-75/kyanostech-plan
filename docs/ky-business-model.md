## Service Model by Race Level

Campaigns at different levels have different resources. Our service model reflects this:

### Small Local Races (no staff/consultants)

- Fully self-service
- Automated onboarding: campaign enters info, system configures monitoring
- Dashboard-first: all insights available without calling support
- CMS-specific instructions: implementers get copy-paste fixes
- Knowledge base and email support only

### Congress, Statewide, National, Major City (have staff/consultants)

- Served through their political consultants
- We train and support the consultant; consultant manages campaign relationship
- Consultant becomes our channel partner and support layer
- Campaigns get hands-on help from people they already trust

**This approach:**

- Keeps marginal cost low for small races (self-service)
- Uses existing consultant relationships for larger races
- Makes consultants a key sales channel
- Matches how campaigns actually operate

## Scope by Tier

Monitoring depth scales with race level:

| Level | Prompts | Surfaces | Locations | Monthly Studies |
|-------|---------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Local | 20 | 3 | 1 | 1 |
| Congress | 35 | 3 | 3 | 1 |
| Statewide | 50 | 3 | 10 | 1 |
| National | 75 | 3+ | 25 | 2-4 |

**Upgrades available:** Additional prompts, surfaces, locations, and monitoring frequency at added cost.

## Campaign Cycle Pricing

Campaigns pay by cycle (primary or general), not monthly. Flat fee regardless of cycle length.

| Race Level | Primary | General | Full Cycle |
|------------|---------|---------|------------|
| **Local** | $900 | $1,200 | $1,800 |
| **Congress** | $4,000 | $5,000 | $8,000 |
| **Statewide** | $15,000 | $20,000 | $30,000 |
| **National** | $200,000 | $250,000 | $400,000 |

**Pricing philosophy:** Margins are progressive. Lower margins on smaller races keep Kyanos accessible. Higher margins on larger races reflect their fundraising capacity. Presidential campaigns raise $1B+; $400K for full-cycle intelligence is a rounding error.
