## Service Model by Race Level

Campaigns at different levels have different resources. Our service model reflects this:

### Small Local Races (no staff/consultants)

- Fully self-service
- Automated onboarding: campaign enters info, system configures monitoring
- Dashboard-first: all insights available without calling support
- CMS-specific instructions: implementers get copy-paste fixes
- Knowledge base and email support only

### Congress, Statewide, National, Major City (have staff/consultants)

- Served through their political consultants
- We train and support the consultant; consultant manages campaign relationship
- Consultant becomes our channel partner and support layer
- Campaigns get hands-on help from people they already trust

**This approach:**

- Keeps marginal cost low for small races (self-service)
- Uses existing consultant relationships for larger races
- Makes consultants a key sales channel
- Matches how campaigns actually operate
