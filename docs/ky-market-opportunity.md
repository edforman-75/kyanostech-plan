# Market & Financial Overview

## Why Campaigns Will Pay

**Internet Presence Optimization protects and amplifies every other media investment a campaign makes.**

When media works (when a voter sees a TV ad, digital campaign, or mail piece), what happens next? They research. They Google the candidate. They ask ChatGPT. If AI gives them bad information, that media spend is wasted.

New research shows AI chatbots are **four times more persuasive** than TV ads ([Rand et al., *Nature*, 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09771-9); [Pennycook et al., *Science*, 2025](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aea3884)). AI isn't just another channel. It's where voters go to validate what they've seen elsewhere.

**Internet Presence Optimization ensures media dollars convert:**

| Investment | Cost per Voter Influenced | Role |
|------------|---------------------------|------|
| Broadcast TV | $100-600 | Awareness |
| CTV/Streaming | $50-150 | Targeted awareness |
| Digital Ads | $50-100 | Engagement |
| **Internet Presence Optimization** | **$1-10** | **Conversion & validation** |

Campaigns will pay for Kyanos because **it makes their entire media strategy more effective**. Internet Presence Optimization is the highest-impact line item in any media budget. It amplifies TV, protects digital spend, and ensures that voter interest converts to voter support.

By 2028, an estimated 45-60% of voter information queries will be answered inside AI environments. Without Internet Presence Optimization, campaigns risk losing voters at the moment of decision, after they've already spent the money to reach them.

## Unit Economics

Based on actual Bentham infrastructure costs, scaled by tier:

### Cost per Study by Tier

| Tier | Queries | Variable Cost | Notes |
|------|---------|---------------|-------|
| Local | 60 (20×3×1) | ~$15 | Minimal scope |
| Congress | 315 (35×3×3) | ~$25 | Moderate scope |
| Statewide | 1,500 (50×3×10) | ~$40 | WatchTower |
| National | 5,625 (75×3×25) | ~$75 | Full coverage |

### Margin by Tier (Full Cycle)

| Tier | Full Cycle Price | Studies | Variable Cost | Per-Unit Overhead | Contribution Margin |
|------|------------------|---------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Local | $2,430 | ~10 | ~$150 | ~$300 | ~81% |
| Congress | $10,800 | ~10 | ~$250 | ~$600 | ~92% |
| Statewide | $40,500 | ~10 | ~$400 | ~$1,500 | ~95% |
| National | $235,000 | ~30 | ~$2,250 | ~$15,000 | ~93% |

*Contribution margins shown before fixed cost allocation (personnel, infrastructure, etc.). Full cycle pricing reflects 20% discount on general election for campaigns continuing from primary.*

**Progressive margin philosophy:** We price smaller races accessibly to serve down-ballot progressives. The high contribution margins across all tiers support fixed cost coverage and mission sustainability.

## Revenue Projections

### 2028 Client Mix (Presidential Year)

## 2026: The Free Year

We're offering free access to progressive campaigns in 2026: full Kyanos access at no cost through primary and general election cycles.

### 2026 Client Mix

| Level | Clients | Cost to Serve | Notes |
|-------|---------|---------------|-------|
| Statewide | 15 | ~$6K each | High-visibility case studies |
| Congress | 50 | ~$2.5K each | Competitive House races |
| Local | 110 | ~$1.5K each | State leg, major city |
| Officeholders | 15 | ~$1K each | 2024 winners transitioning |
| Organizations | 10 | ~$2K each | Consultant partners |
| **Total** | **200** | **~$330K** | |

**Investment in Reference Base:** The $330K cost to serve these clients is our investment in building a reference base (case studies, testimonials, and proof of impact) that drives 2027 paid conversions and 2028 growth.

### Rollout

- **Q2 (Founding Cohort):** First 50 campaigns with hands-on support
- **Q3 (Expansion):** Additional campaigns as capacity allows
- **Q4:** Case studies published; 2027 pricing announced

### Why Free?

- Builds credibility with measurable results
- Generates case studies for 2027 sales
- Creates visibility heading into 2028
- Positions Kyanos as essential progressive infrastructure
- Removes price as an objection for an unproven and novel service
- We learn quickly what works and what doesn't

## Commercial Services Business

### AI Monitoring as a Service

Our Bentham infrastructure is purpose-built for running AI monitoring studies at scale. While built to power Kyanos products, its multi-tenant architecture enables us to offer AI monitoring as a service to aligned clients.

**Current Operations:**

- Multi-tenant infrastructure serving Kyanos and commercial clients
- Proven with existing clients (brand monitoring)
- Per-study and retainer pricing models

### Target Markets

| Market | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| CPG/Retail brands | Monitor AI representation of products |
| Marketing agencies | Competitive intelligence, AI visibility research |
| Academic researchers | AI behavior studies |
| International progressive orgs | Global political monitoring |

### Pricing Model

- Per-study: $500-$5,000 depending on scope
- Retainer: Monthly monitoring packages

### Strategic Value

- Generates revenue outside election cycles
- Subsidizes progressive political mission with commercial income
- Provides sustainability independent of foundation support
- Does not dilute political mission: separate market, shared infrastructure

**Timing:** We do not plan to actively market Bentham's commercial capabilities until after the 2028 cycle. The political mission comes first; commercial expansion can wait.
