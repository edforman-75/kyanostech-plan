# Team & Governance

## Trust Structure

Kyanos operates as a **Trust-Owned LLC**:

- **Trust entity** owns 100% of Kyanos LLC
- **Board of trustees** (3-5 progressive leaders) governs trust
- **Trust charter** locks in progressive-only service, prevents hostile acquisition
- **Operating LLC** handles day-to-day business

### Why Trust-Owned?

The trust structure follows the Catalist precedent (the voter file company that serves virtually every major Democratic campaign). A trust-owned structure:

- Prevents sale to hostile buyers
- Locks in progressive mission permanently
- Allows for sustainable revenue generation
- Attracts foundation PRIs and grants
- Provides governance stability across leadership changes

## Founder

**[Ed Forman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edforman/)** brings 35 years of Silicon Valley experience to Kyanos, having been an early employee at eleven startups across decision-support systems, databases, wireless, and interactive media. He holds an MBA from Stanford, where he later taught entrepreneurship and business-model design to mid-career executives.

After his startup career, Ed spent a year in Ghana through Stanford's SEED program, coaching companies across West Africa. That experience reshaped how he thinks about building capacity in systems, whether economic or political, before crisis hits.

The idea for Kyanos emerged from a breakfast conversation with Scott Anderson of Strategic Victory Fund in Sun Valley: *"What threats to progressives are on the horizon that we're not seeing?"* The answer: **AI chatbots will be to 2028 what podcasts were to 2024.** Progressives can't afford to be caught flat-footed again.

Ed's role is as architect and advisor: assembling the team, framing the problem, and designing a structure that outlasts any one individual. He won't take an operational role, but he's committed to ensuring democracy has a seat inside the new information infrastructure before it's built without us.

*For a deeper conversation with Ed about Kyanos and his thinking, see the [Founder Interview](ky-white-paper-founder-interview.md).*
