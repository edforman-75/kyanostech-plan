# Executive Summary

**Keeping progressives visible in the AI era**

*Making sure voters find the truth about progressive candidates*

---

When voters ask AI about a candidate, the answer should be accurate—not a hallucination, not a hedge, not the opponent's framing.

Kyanos is a family of AI-driven analytical and remediation services that help progressive candidates, organizations, and causes manage their digital presence. We monitor how AI systems, search engines, advertising platforms, and opponents represent our clients—then provide specific, actionable fixes that campaigns can implement immediately.

<div class="callout-title">Why "Kyanos"?</div>
<p><em>Kyanos</em> (κύανος) is the ancient Greek word for "blue"—the root of English "cyan." We chose it because blue is the color of progressive politics, and because we're building something foundational: the infrastructure that keeps progressives visible in the AI era.</p>

## The Mission

Progressives must never fall behind on communication technology. Every era brings new channels that reshape how voters learn about candidates—radio (FDR), television (JFK), internet (Obama), social media (Obama), podcasts (Trump). AI is next. Kyanos exists to keep progressives at the leading edge.

<div class="callout-title">The Lesson of 2024</div>
<p><strong>AI chatbots will be to 2028 what podcasts were to 2024.</strong></p>
<p>In 2024, progressives were caught flat-footed as conservatives dominated the podcast landscape. We can't make the same mistake with AI. By 2028, millions of voters will ask chatbots who to vote for. We need to be ready.</p>

## The ROI Case

**Digital presence optimization protects and amplifies every other media investment a campaign makes.**

When your media works—when a voter sees your TV ad or digital campaign—what do they do next? They Google the candidate. They ask ChatGPT. They research.

Both search engines and AI systems cite the sources they can find. Your website content and structure determines what voters see. If your digital presence is weak, you've wasted that media spend.

New research published in *Nature* and *Science* (December 2025) found that AI chatbots are **4 times more persuasive** than television advertising. AI isn't just another channel—it's where voters go to validate what they've seen elsewhere.

| Investment | Cost per Voter | Role |
|------------|----------------|------|
| Broadcast TV | $100-600 | Awareness |
| Digital Ads | $50-100 | Engagement |
| **AI Optimization** | **$1-10** | **Conversion & validation** |

AI optimization ensures your media dollars convert. It's the highest-leverage line item in any media budget—amplifying TV, protecting digital spend, and ensuring voter interest becomes voter support.

## The Watchdog Role

AI platforms are controlled by investors with political agendas and subject to pressure from a President who demands loyalty. Kyanos continuously monitors how major AI systems respond to questions about progressive candidates and issues, detects geographic variation through Panopticon's Watchtowers, and documents changes. If models shift against progressives, we'll know first and sound the alarm.

## The Products

Kyanos offers a suite of services:

- **Panopticon** — Core AI monitoring and remediation across major surfaces
- **GoodInk** — Positive press discovery for campaigns to feature
- **Adwatch** — Political advertising monitoring across Google and Meta
- **TripWire** — Opponent website change detection

## The Methodology

We don't just report problems—we trace them to root causes and provide fixes campaigns can actually implement:

1. **Observe:** What do AI surfaces, search engines, and opponents say?
2. **Trace:** Where did they get that information?
3. **Diagnose:** What's the fixable root cause?
4. **Prescribe:** Specific instructions tailored to the campaign's CMS and tech stack

We focus on what campaigns can change, not "shoulda/woulda."
