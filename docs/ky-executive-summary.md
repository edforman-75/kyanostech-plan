# Executive Summary

**Keeping progressives visible in the AI era**

*Making sure voters find the truth about progressive candidates*

---

When voters ask AI about a candidate, the answer should be accurate—not a hallucination, not a hedge, not outdated, not the opponent's framing.

Kyanos is an internet presence optimization platform that ensures progressive candidates, organizations, and causes are accurately and favorably represented across three surfaces: AI chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Grok, Meta AI), AI-integrated search (Google AI Overviews, Bing Copilot), and traditional search results. We monitor, diagnose, and provide specific, actionable fixes that campaigns can implement immediately.

<div class="callout-title">Why Kyanos</div>
<p><em>Kyanos</em> is the ancient Greek word for "blue," the root of English "cyan." We chose it because blue is the color of progressive politics, and because we're building something foundational: the infrastructure that keeps progressives visible in the AI era.</p>

## The Mission

Progressives must never fall behind on communication technology. Every era brings new channels that reshape how voters learn about candidates—radio (FDR), television (JFK), internet (Obama), social media (Obama), podcasts (Trump). AI is next. Kyanos exists to keep progressives at the leading edge.

<div class="callout-title">The Lesson of 2024</div>
<p><strong>AI chatbots will be to 2028 what podcasts were to 2024.</strong></p>
<p>In 2024, progressives were caught flat-footed as conservatives dominated the podcast landscape. We can't make the same mistake with AI. By 2028, millions of voters will ask chatbots who to vote for. We need to be ready.</p>

## The ROI Case

**Digital presence optimization protects and amplifies every other media investment a campaign makes.**

When a campaign's media works—when a voter sees a TV ad or digital campaign—what do they do next? They Google the candidate. They ask ChatGPT. They research.

Both search engines and AI systems cite the sources they can find. A campaign's website content and structure determines what voters see. If the digital presence is weak, that media spend is wasted.

New research published in *Nature* and *Science* (December 2025) found that AI chatbots are **four times more persuasive** than television advertising. AI isn't just another channel—it's where voters go to validate what they've seen elsewhere.

| Investment | Cost per Voter | Role |
|------------|----------------|------|
| Broadcast TV | $100-600 | Awareness |
| Digital Ads | $50-100 | Engagement |
| **Internet Presence Optimization** | **$1-10** | **Conversion & validation** |

Internet Presence Optimization ensures media dollars convert. It's the highest-impact line item in any campaign budget, amplifying TV, protecting digital spend, and ensuring voter interest becomes voter support.

## The Watchdog Role

AI platforms are subject to pressure from a President who demands loyalty. **We cannot prevent platforms from becoming biased against progressives**—but we can detect it early and document it thoroughly.

Kyanos continuously monitors how major AI systems respond to questions about progressive candidates and issues, detects geographic variation through WatchTower, and builds an evidence base of platform behavior over time. If models shift against progressives, we'll know first and sound the alarm.

Our high-quality observational data supports PR campaigns and litigation efforts. The [Kyanos Research Institute](ky-team-governance.md#kyanos-research-institute) will publish independent research documenting platform bias—creating the public accountability that platforms cannot ignore.

## Product Capabilities

Kyanos offers six integrated capabilities. *See [Appendix 5: Capabilities Architecture](ky-appendix-f-capabilities-architecture.html) for a visual overview.*

## The Methodology

We don't just report problems. We trace them to root causes and provide fixes campaigns can actually implement:

1. **Observe:** What do AI surfaces, search engines, and opponents say?
2. **Trace:** Where did they get that information?
3. **Diagnose:** What's the fixable root cause?
4. **Prescribe:** Specific instructions tailored to the campaign's CMS and tech stack

We focus on what campaigns can change, not "shoulda/woulda."
