# Problem & Market Opportunity

## The Problem

Voters are changing how they seek political information. Instead of visiting campaign websites or watching debates, they ask AI assistants:

- "What does [Candidate] think about abortion?"
- "Who should I vote for in [District]?"
- "What's the difference between [Candidate A] and [Candidate B]?"

AI systems synthesize answers from across the web. If progressive content isn't structured for machine readability, these systems may:

- Miss progressive positions entirely
- Hallucinate incorrect policy stances
- Favor better-optimized conservative content
- Fail to cite authoritative progressive sources

**This is not hypothetical.** Our monitoring shows significant variance in how AI systems represent candidate positions, with properly structured content receiving preferential citation.

## The 80/20 Reality

Not all AI surfaces matter equally. Our market analysis shows:

| Surface | Election Query Share | Voter Impact |
|---------|---------------------|--------------|
| Google AI Overviews | 40-45% | 15-17M voters |
| ChatGPT | 10-12% | 4-5M voters |
| Meta AI | 8-10% | 8-10M voters (critical for Hispanic voters) |
| All others combined | ~35% | Fragmented |

**Strategic implication:** Focus on Google, ChatGPT, and Meta AI. These three surfaces capture ~60% of election AI queries and reach the most strategically important voter segments.

We can monitor any surface. We recommend campaigns focus on the core three unless they have specific reasons to expand.

## Geographic Variation

Panopticon's Watchtowers have detected that AI systems return different answers in different locations. Swing state voters may see different information than safe state voters. This has profound implications for campaign strategy and for platform accountability.

<div class="callout-title">The Watchdog Imperative</div>
<p>AI platforms are controlled by investors with political agendas and subject to pressure from a President who demands loyalty. If models shift against progressives, whether through deliberate manipulation or algorithmic drift, someone needs to detect it first and document the evidence.</p>
<p>Kyanos provides that watchdog function, with Watchtowers that can detect geographic manipulation and build an evidence base for accountability.</p>

## Why Now

1. **AI adoption is accelerating.** ChatGPT reached 100M users faster than any application in history; Google AI Overviews now appear on 50%+ of informational queries.

2. **2026 cycle timing.** The midterms are months away; solutions implemented now impact competitive races this cycle and establish credibility for 2028.

3. **No incumbent.** The progressive technology network has voter files (Catalist), CRMs (NGP VAN), and fundraising tools (ActBlue), but nothing for AI-era digital presence management.

4. **Platform capture risk.** Major AI platforms face pressure from a hostile administration; progressives need independent monitoring infrastructure.
