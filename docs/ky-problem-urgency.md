# Problem & Market Opportunity

## The Problem

Voters are changing how they seek political information. Instead of visiting campaign websites or watching debates, they ask AI assistants:

- "What does [Candidate] think about abortion?"
- "Who should I vote for in [District]?"
- "What's the difference between [Candidate A] and [Candidate B]?"

AI systems synthesize answers from across the web. If progressive content isn't structured for machine readability, these systems may:

- Miss progressive positions entirely
- Hallucinate incorrect policy stances
- Favor better-optimized conservative content
- Fail to cite authoritative progressive sources

**This is not hypothetical.** Our monitoring shows significant variance in how AI systems represent candidate positions, with properly structured content receiving preferential citation.

## The 80/20 Reality

Not all surfaces matter equally for voter discovery. Our market analysis shows:

| Surface | Relative Importance | Notes |
|---------|---------------------|-------|
| Google (Search + AI Overviews) | Highest | Traditional search and AI Overviews both draw from the same website content |
| ChatGPT | High | Influential with early adopters and information seekers |
| Meta AI | Growing | Critical for reaching Hispanic voters |
| All others | Monitor | Perplexity, Copilot, Gemini, Claude, Grok |

**Strategic implication:** Focus on Google, ChatGPT, and Meta AI. Optimizing for these three surfaces also improves results across all others. Our research shows that campaigns with strong digital presence on the core platforms see benefits across the entire search and AI landscape.

**Important:** This isn't just about AI. Traditional Google search (without AI Overviews) also relies on the same website content and structure. A campaign's digital presence improvement benefits all discovery channels.

## Geographic Variation

Kyanos WatchTower has detected that AI systems return different answers in different locations. Swing state voters may see different information than safe state voters. This has profound implications for campaign strategy and for platform accountability.

<div class="callout-title">The Watchdog Imperative</div>
<p>AI platforms are subject to pressure from a President who demands loyalty. If models shift against progressives, whether through deliberate manipulation or algorithmic drift, someone needs to detect it first and build the evidence base.</p>
<p>Kyanos provides that watchdog function, with WatchTower that can detect geographic manipulation and build an evidence base for accountability.</p>

## Why Now

1. **AI adoption is accelerating.** Voters increasingly get political information from AI assistants. ChatGPT reached 100M users faster than any application in history; Google AI Overviews now appear on 50%+ of informational queries. *See [Appendix 2: AI Surface Market Share](ky-appendix-b-surface-coverage.md) for detailed projections.*

2. **2026 cycle timing.** Solutions implemented now impact this cycle. More importantly, we need to gain experience and build a reference base before the 2028 campaign starts.

3. **No incumbent.** The progressive technology network has voter files (Catalist), CRMs (NGP VAN), and fundraising tools (ActBlue), but nothing for AI-era digital presence management. If someone else were doing this, we would gladly collaborate—but no one is.
