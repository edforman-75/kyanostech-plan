# Risks & Mitigations

## Funding & Financial Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Initial funding delayed** | Parallel outreach to multiple sources; working MVP demonstrates viability |
| **2027 revenue misses projections** | Free year generates pipeline; commercial services provide backup revenue |
| **Campaign payment defaults** | Reserve fund; consultant partners absorb credit risk |

---

## Technology Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **AI platforms change APIs or web interfaces** | Technical Director monitors changes; diversified approach across sources |
| **Platforms block monitoring** | Multiple access methods; budget for maintenance |
| **Bot detection services (Cloudflare, etc.)** | Cat-and-mouse game since the web began; many industries depend on web data access; budget for specialized expertise |
| **Platform becomes hostile to progressives** | WatchTower detects early; Research Institute documents evidence |

---

## Operational Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Key person risk** | Trust board with succession rules; documented processes |
| **Bentham needs constant supervision** | Dedicated Operations Manager from launch |
| **Support burden exceeds capacity** | Product designed for self-serve; CMS-specific instructions reduce touch |

---

## Political Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **AI regulation restricts optimization** | We do content structuring, not manipulation; likely to benefit from regulation |
| **Platform policies restrict political content** | Follow platform rules; adjust quickly |
| **Administration pressure on AI platforms** | Core reason Kyanos exists; WatchTower and Research Institute provide documentation |

---

## Market Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Campaigns slow to adopt** | Free year removes cost barrier; consultant channel provides trusted recommendation |
| **Competitors enter market** | This is a good thing—our goal is to have an impact, not to monopolize a market. First-mover advantage; trust structure creates credibility |
| **Commercial services don't scale** | Commercial is bonus revenue; core business sustainable without it |

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### Funding Risk: Foundation PRIs Don't Close

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High

**Scenario:** Progressive foundations are slow to commit PRIs, delaying funding past March 15 deadline.

**Mitigations:**

- Parallel conversations with multiple foundations
- Labor union funding as alternative/supplement
- Family office donors as backup
- MVP demonstrates viability before funding closes
- Minimum viable funding level ($750K) allows launch with reduced scope

### Technology Risk: Platforms Change APIs or Web Interfaces

**Likelihood:** High (certain to happen)
**Impact:** Medium

**Scenario:** Google, OpenAI, or Meta changes their APIs or web presentations.

**Mitigations:**

- Technical Director monitors platform changes
- Multiple extraction methods in Bentham
- Budget for ongoing maintenance
- Relationships with platform developer programs
- Diversified approach: no single-platform dependency

### Operational Risk: Self-Service Doesn't Work

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium

**Scenario:** Local campaigns need more support than self-service model provides.

**Mitigations:**

- CMS-specific instructions reduce complexity
- Knowledge base for common issues
- Email support included in all tiers
- Consultant channel absorbs higher-touch needs
- Product designed for campaign staff, not candidates

### Political Risk: Platform Manipulation

**Likelihood:** Medium-High
**Impact:** High

**Scenario:** AI platforms deliberately skew results against progressives under political pressure.

**Mitigations:**

- WatchTower detects geographic manipulation
- Research Institute documents evidence
- Public reporting creates accountability
- Core reason Kyanos exists: we're the watchdog
- Data supports legal and policy advocacy

### Market Risk: Competitors Copy Model

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Low (actually positive)

**Scenario:** Another organization launches similar progressive AI monitoring service.

**Response:** This is a good thing. Our goal is to have an impact on progressive representation in AI systems, not to monopolize a market. If competitors emerge, it validates the problem and expands the ecosystem. We maintain advantages through:

- Trust structure creates credibility competitors can't match
- First-mover advantage in partner relationships
- Bentham infrastructure is operational and proven
- Case studies and reference customers by 2027
- Mission alignment attracts progressive talent

### Technology Risk: Bot Detection Services

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium

**Scenario:** Services like Cloudflare improve bot detection, potentially blocking automated queries to AI platforms.

**Mitigations:**

- This has been a cat-and-mouse game since the web began
- Many sectors of American commerce depend on web data access (price comparison, market research, competitive intelligence)
- Budget for specialized expertise to stay ahead of detection methods
- Multiple extraction approaches reduce single-point-of-failure risk
- Relationships with platform developer programs provide legitimate access paths

## Risk Monitoring

### Quarterly Risk Review

- CEO reviews risk register with board
- Update likelihood and impact assessments
- Document new risks and mitigation effectiveness
- Adjust plans as needed

### Key Risk Indicators

| Indicator | Threshold | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Funding commitments | <$500K by Feb 15 | Accelerate alternative sources |
| Platform monitoring failures | >10% query failure rate | Technical investigation |
| Client satisfaction (NPS) | <30 | Product/support review |
| 2027 conversion rate | <30% | Pricing/value prop review |

## Contingency Plans

### If Funding Falls Short ($750K minimum not met)

- Reduce team to 3 FTEs
- Delay GoodInk and AdWatch launches
- Focus on Panopticon core only
- Serve 100 campaigns instead of 200
- Extend timeline for 2027 revenue

### If Platform Access Blocked

- Shift to public data sources only
- Partner with academic researchers for access
- Document blocking as evidence of platform hostility
- Adjust product to work with available data

### If 2027 Revenue Misses Target

- Extend free access selectively
- Accelerate commercial services
- Reduce 2027 expenses
- Seek bridge funding if needed

### If Demand Exceeds Capacity

- Raise prices to manage demand
- Reduce outreach to local campaigns
- Prioritize higher-impact races
- Expand team faster with revenue
