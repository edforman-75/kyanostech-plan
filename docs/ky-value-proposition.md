# The Value Proposition: Why Digital Presence Optimization Is the Best Investment a Campaign Can Make

**The ROI case for AI presence management**

---

## The Bottom Line

| Metric | Traditional Media | Internet Presence Optimization |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Cost per voter influenced** | $50-600 | $1-10 |
| **Persuasion effectiveness** | Baseline | **4x more effective** |
| **When it reaches voters** | Interruption | Active research moment |

**Digital Presence Optimization delivers 10-100x the return on investment of traditional campaign advertising.**

This isn't speculation. It's supported by peer-reviewed research published in the world's most prestigious scientific journals.

## The Research

### Finding 1: Traditional Campaign Contact Has Near-Zero Persuasion Effect

**Source:** [Kalla & Broockman (2018)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/minimal-persuasive-effects-of-campaign-contact-in-general-elections-evidence-from-49-field-experiments/753665A313C4AB433DBF7110299B7433), *American Political Science Review*

A meta-analysis of 49 field experiments found:

> "The best estimate of the effects of campaign contact and advertising on Americans' candidate choices in general elections is zero."

Door-to-door canvassing, phone banking, direct mail, and television advertising show **minimal persuasive effects** in general elections. The billions spent on traditional voter contact largely fail to move opinions.

**The exception:** Persuasion *does* work in **low-information environments**—primaries, down-ballot races, and situations where voters are actively seeking information they don't have.

### Finding 2: AI Chatbots Are 4x More Persuasive Than Television Ads

**Sources:**
- [Rand et al. (2025)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09771-9), *Nature* — "Persuading voters using human–artificial intelligence dialogues"
- [Pennycook et al. (2025)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aea3884), *Science* — "The levers of political persuasion with conversational artificial intelligence"

Landmark studies published simultaneously in December 2025 by MIT's David Rand and Cornell's Gordon Pennycook found:

- **In the 2024 U.S. election:** A pro-Harris AI chatbot moved Trump supporters **3.9 points** on a 100-point scale—roughly **4 times the measured effect** of political advertisements in 2016 and 2020.

- **In Canadian and Polish elections:** AI chatbots achieved shifts of **~10 percentage points** among opposition voters.

- **When optimized for persuasion:** AI achieved opinion shifts of up to **25 percentage points**.

The researchers concluded that AI chatbots achieve persuasion primarily through providing factual claims and polite communication—exactly what well-optimized campaign content enables.

**Key quote from David Rand:** "This is a shockingly large effect... especially in the context of presidential politics."

### Finding 3: AI Reaches Voters at the Persuadable Moment

Traditional advertising interrupts voters during other activities. AI reaches voters **at the exact moment they're actively researching candidates**—when they're most persuadable.

- **62% of voters** use the internet to research candidates (Pew Research, 2024)
- **40-45% of Google searches** now show AI Overviews before traditional links
- **100M+ weekly users** use ChatGPT in the US
- By 2028, an estimated **45-60% of voter information queries** will be answered inside AI environments

When a voter asks "Who should I vote for in [race]?" or "Is [candidate] honest?", the AI response shapes their perception—often before they ever visit a campaign website.

## The Cost Comparison

### Cost Per Voter Influenced

| Method | Cost per Voter | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Broadcast TV (major market) | $100-600 | High waste, low targeting |
| CTV/Streaming | $50-150 | Better targeting, still expensive |
| Digital Advertising | $50-100 | Low conversion rates |
| Direct Mail | $40-200 | Multiple touches required |
| Door-to-Door Canvassing | $19-29 | Turnout effect only, not persuasion |
| **AI Presence Optimization** | **$1-10** | Highest ROI |

**And it gets worse near Election Day.** Media rates are bid up dramatically in the final weeks of a campaign—precisely when persuasion matters most. Television rates can double or triple in competitive markets as campaigns flood the airwaves. Digital CPMs spike. Direct mail vendors are booked solid.

AI presence optimization doesn't suffer from this problem. The cost to monitor and fix your AI presence is the same in October as it is in June. While competitors are paying 3x for diminishing TV inventory, campaigns with strong AI presence continue reaching researching voters at the same low cost.

### What Internet Presence Optimization Costs

| Component | Investment |
|-----------|------------|
| Website content improvements | Staff time (16-24 hours) |
| SEO and schema markup | One-time setup |
| Third-party source updates | Staff time |
| Ongoing AI monitoring | $500-2,000/month |
| **Total (typical campaign)** | **$1,500-15,000** |

### Voters Influenced (Example: Competitive Congressional Race)

| Funnel Stage | Estimate |
|--------------|----------|
| Expected turnout | 60,000-80,000 |
| Research candidates online (62%) | 37,000-50,000 |
| Encounter AI responses (40-45%) | 15,000-22,000 |
| **Influenced by improved AI (10-20%)** | **1,500-4,400** |

**Cost per voter influenced:** $1,500-15,000 ÷ 1,500-4,400 = **$0.35-10.00**

## The Strategic Implication

### For Campaigns

Digital presence optimization isn't a replacement for traditional media strategy—it's the foundation that makes everything else work.

Consider what happens when your media succeeds: A voter sees your TV ad, hears your radio spot, or encounters your digital campaign. They're interested. **What do they do next?** They Google the candidate. They ask ChatGPT. They research.

Both search engines and AI systems cite the sources they can find. If your website doesn't have the content—or has the wrong content—that's what voters see. It's not magic. It's not algorithmic mystery. **Your digital presence determines what browsers and AI systems present to voters.**

If the search results and AI responses are bad—outdated information, opponent framing, or errors—you've wasted that media spend. The voter's positive impression evaporates the moment they research.

**Digital presence optimization protects your media investment.** It ensures that when voters follow up on your advertising, they find accurate, favorable information that reinforces your message. Every dollar spent on TV, digital, and mail becomes more effective when your web presence is optimized.

And the cost is minimal: **$1-10 per voter influenced**, compared to $50-600 for the media that drives them to research. Internet Presence Optimization is the highest-leverage spend in the entire media plan.

### For the Progressive Movement

If progressives fail to invest in AI presence optimization while conservatives do, we will repeat the podcast mistake of 2020-2024—arriving late to a medium that reshapes how voters learn about candidates.

The good news: Internet Presence Optimization is **cheaper and more accessible** than building podcast networks or buying television time. A $10,000 investment in Internet Presence Optimization can match the persuasive impact of a $300,000 TV buy.

The progressive movement has an opportunity to achieve communication parity—or even advantage—at a fraction of historical costs. But only if we act now.
