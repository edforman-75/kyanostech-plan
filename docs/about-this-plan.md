## Authorship and Methodology

This plan was created with the assistance of writing partners [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) and [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt), who also served as lead researchers. Their work was **guided and overseen by the primary author**, who takes full responsibility for all errors and omissions. 

Like any authoring team, AI writing partners can sometimes get confused, mis-source factual information, or make modeling mistakes. If you notice any problems, please contact Ed at [forman.ed@gmail.com](mailto:forman.ed@gmail.com).

## Purpose

The goal of assembling this plan is to **accelerate a response to the deep challenge posed by chatbots to Democratic political candidates and officeholders**.

The emergence of AI-powered information systems represents a fundamental shift in how voters discover and evaluate political information. This plan outlines a strategic response that ensures Democratic values and candidates maintain fair representation in these critical information channels.

## Document Status

This is a **work in progress** and very much a living document designed to **move the discussion along and invite feedback**. The business plan represents our current thinking about market opportunities, technical feasibility, and strategic positioning, but should be viewed as a starting point for dialogue rather than a final proposal.

**We actively welcome input on:**
- Market assumptions and opportunity sizing
- Technical approach and feasibility assessments
- Financial projections and business model validation
- Strategic positioning and competitive analysis
- Implementation timeline and resource requirements

The plan will evolve continuously based on:
- Market research and customer discovery findings
- Technical validation of AI optimization approaches  
- Pilot program results and customer feedback
- Competitive landscape changes
- Regulatory and platform policy developments
- **Stakeholder input and collaborative refinement**

See the **Change Log** for version history once the site is published.

## About the Company Name

**KyanosTech** is a *placeholder company name* chosen for this business plan. The name derives from the Greek word κυανός (kyanos), meaning "blue," combined with "technology" - reflecting both the Democratic political alignment and the ancient Greek heritage of democracy itself.

The name appears potentially trademarkable and relevant domains seem available at the time of writing, but the name is not yet in use. Final branding decisions will be made in consultation with founding team members and legal counsel.

## Strategic Context

This plan addresses an urgent and evolving challenge: the potential for AI systems to inadvertently or deliberately misrepresent Democratic candidates and progressive political positions. As AI chatbots become primary sources of political information, ensuring accurate and fair representation becomes critical infrastructure for democratic participation.

The solutions proposed here - sophisticated schema markup, AI optimization, and platform monitoring - represent both immediate tactical responses and long-term strategic positioning for the era of AI-mediated political information.
