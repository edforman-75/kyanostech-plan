## Channel Strategy

### Two Distinct Motions

| Segment | Channel | Support Model |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Small Local | Direct to campaign | Self-service |
| Congress+ | Through consultants | Consultant-supported |

### By Customer Count

| Channel | % of Customers | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| Direct self-service (small Local) | 40% | High volume, low touch |
| Consultant partners (Congress+) | 35% | Consultant manages relationship |
| PAC/committee sponsored | 20% | Volume deals for multiple campaigns |
| Referrals | 5% | Word of mouth |

### By Revenue

| Channel | % of Revenue |
|---------|--------------|
| Consultant partners | 50% |
| PAC/committee sponsored | 30% |
| Direct self-service | 15% |
| Referrals | 5% |

**Consultants are the primary revenue channel** because they bring larger races with higher price points.

## Consultant Partnership Model

### Why Consultants

- They already have trusted relationships with campaigns
- They make technology recommendations
- They provide a support layer we don't have to build
- They sometimes provide resources to implement recommendations
- They become a sales channel

### How It Works

1. We train consultants on Kyanos products
2. Consultant recommends Kyanos to their campaign clients
3. Consultant provides implementation support
4. We provide technical support to consultant
5. Consultant earns commission on referred revenue

### Value to Consultants

- Differentiated service offering
- Commission income
- Early access to AI monitoring capabilities
- Training and certification

## Self-Service Model (Local Races)

### Design Principles

- **Zero friction onboarding:** Campaign enters info, system configures automatically
- **Dashboard-first:** All insights available without human support
- **CMS-specific instructions:** Copy-paste fixes for WordPress, Squarespace, etc.
- **Knowledge base:** Self-serve help for common questions

### Support Tiers

| Tier | Response | Cost |
|------|----------|------|
| Knowledge base | Instant | Included |
| Email support | 48 hours | Included |
| Priority email | 24 hours | Upgrade |
