## Executive Summary

### The Bottom Line

**When New Jersey voters ask Google or ChatGPT about Tom Malinowski, they see ethics complaints and stock trading violations first.** The blind trust resolution, the co-sponsorship of the stock trading ban, and the human rights credentials are buried or missing entirely.

Google AI Overview—the box at the top of search results that millions see—doesn't even know there's a 2026 campaign. It shows only historical information from the 2019-2023 term.

The good news: **the campaign can fix most of this by updating the website.** AI systems cite the sources they can find. Right now, the only sources discussing Malinowski and honesty are hostile. The campaign website has no ethics page, no endorsements page, and a news section last updated in 2020.

### Platform Scores

| Platform | Score | Assessment |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Google AI Overview | D | No mention of current campaign. Only shows 2019-2023 history. |
| ChatGPT | C | Ethics violations featured prominently. Blind trust not mentioned. |
| Google Knowledge Panel | C | Shows "Former" Representative, not current candidate. |

### Key Findings

1. **Google AI Overview doesn't mention the current campaign** — The AI summary at the top of Google Search only shows "served from 2019 to 2023." No mention of NJ-11 or the February 2026 election.

2. **ChatGPT leads with ethics violations on trust questions** — When voters ask "Is Tom Malinowski honest?", ChatGPT opens with STOCK Act violations before mentioning his diplomatic career or the blind trust resolution.

3. **Campaign website has no counter-narrative** — No ethics FAQ page, no endorsements page, no immigration page despite the compelling refugee story.

4. **News section last updated April 2020** — 5 positive articles from the past 60 days aren't on the website.

5. **Human rights credentials work across all platforms** — This narrative works because it has source consistency—apply this model to other topics.

## Monitor: What AI Platforms Say

### Google AI Overview

**Score: D — Current campaign invisible**

Google AI Overview shows only historical information from 2019-2023. There is no mention of the NJ-11 special election, the February 2026 primary, or the fact that Malinowski is currently running for Congress.

**What voters see (query: "Tom Malinowski"):**

> "Tom Malinowski is an American politician and diplomat who **served as the U.S. representative for New Jersey's 7th congressional district from 2019 to 2023**. He is a member of the Democratic Party."

**What's Missing:**

- 2026 NJ-11 special election candidacy
- February 5, 2026 primary date
- Andy Kim endorsement
- Any indication he's currently running

### ChatGPT

**Score: C — Ethics violations prominent, resolution buried**

ChatGPT provides more complete information than Google but leads with the negative. The blind trust and ethics reform advocacy appear late in responses or not at all.

**Query: "Is Tom Malinowski honest?"**

> "Tom Malinowski faced **ethics investigations related to stock trading** during his time in Congress. He failed to disclose multiple stock transactions as required by the STOCK Act... However, he has also been recognized for his work on human rights issues during his career at the State Department and Human Rights Watch."

**The Problem:** When a voter asks about honesty, the first thing they learn is about ethics violations. The human rights credentials appear as an afterthought. The blind trust resolution doesn't appear at all.

**Query: "Tom Malinowski immigration"**

> "As a Democrat, Tom Malinowski has generally supported **comprehensive immigration reform** and opposed the Trump administration's immigration policies. He has advocated for DACA protections..."

**What's Missing:**

- Fled Communist Poland at age 6 with his mother
- Personal refugee experience shapes policy views
- Human Rights Watch work on refugee issues
- Specific positions on current immigration debates

**Why:** The campaign website has no immigration page. ChatGPT has no authoritative source to cite.

### Google Knowledge Panel

**Score: C — Shows "Former" Representative, not current candidate**

Many voters search Google without AI Mode enabled. They see the Knowledge Panel—a prominent box on the right side of search results—which currently labels Malinowski as "Former United States Representative."

**What the Knowledge Panel Shows:**

- **Title:** "Former United States Representative"
- **Age:** 60 years (Sep 23, 1965)
- **Previous Offices:** Representative, NJ 7th District
- **Overview:** Pulls from Wikipedia—mentions diplomat, former representative, State Department service
- **Sources:** Ballotpedia, CTCL, Wikipedia
- **Social Profiles:** Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, X (Twitter)

**The Problem:** The Knowledge Panel doesn't mention the 2026 campaign. The "Candidate for: 2026 US House New Jersey District 11" line appears in small text at the bottom—easy to miss.

### What Works: Human Rights Credentials

ChatGPT consistently surfaces the human rights background. This narrative works because it has source consistency.

**Query: "Tom Malinowski background"**

> "Tom Malinowski served as **Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor** under President Obama (2014-2017). Before that, he was the **Washington director for Human Rights Watch** for over a decade, where he advocated for human rights and democracy around the world..."

**This is the model.** Wikipedia features it, the campaign website mentions it, news coverage references it. AI platforms find consistent sourcing, so they reliably surface it. Apply this pattern to topics that aren't working.

## Analyze: Why AI Says What It Says

### The Causality Chain

Understanding how AI responses are formed reveals how to change them:

1. **Campaign Creates Content** → Website pages, press releases, social media posts, news interviews

2. **Search Engines Index** → Google crawls and indexes content, assigns authority scores, determines what's relevant

3. **AI Retrieves & Synthesizes** → AI platforms query search indices, pull from authoritative sources, generate responses

4. **Voter Sees Response** → The AI summary shapes first impressions, often before any campaign contact

### What the Campaign Controls

| Control Level | Actions | Impact on AI |
|---------------|---------|--------------|
| **High** | Website content, page structure, SEO, press releases | Direct: AI cites campaign website |
| **Medium** | Press pitches, endorsement announcements, social media | Indirect: generates coverage AI cites |
| **Low** | Wikipedia, Ballotpedia, opponent messaging | Can influence through proper channels |

### Source Analysis by Topic

**Topic: Ethics/Honesty**

| Source | What It Says | Campaign Control |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| News articles (NJ.com, Politico) | Stock violations, ethics complaints | Low — can pitch counter-stories |
| Wikipedia | Mentions controversy, no resolution | Low — Talk page requests only |
| Campaign website | **No ethics page exists** | **High — create one** |

**AI Conclusion:** "Ethics violations" because that's all the sources discuss.

**Topic: Current Campaign**

| Source | What It Says | Campaign Control |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| Wikipedia | No mention of 2026 race | Low |
| Ballotpedia | Shows candidacy | Medium — can update |
| Campaign website | Homepage mentions race | High |
| News coverage | Recent articles exist | Low |

**AI Conclusion:** Google AI Overview misses it because Wikipedia (its primary source) doesn't mention it.

**Topic: Human Rights**

| Source | What It Says | Campaign Control |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| Wikipedia | Extensive HRW and State Dept coverage | Low |
| Campaign website | Mentions in bio | High |
| News archives | Consistent coverage | Low |

**AI Conclusion:** Works across all platforms because sources agree.

### Priorities by Control and Impact

| Priority | Action | Control | Impact | Why |
|----------|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| 1 | Create ethics FAQ page | High | High | Only the campaign can provide resolution narrative |
| 2 | Update homepage SEO | High | High | Tells Google this is a current candidate |
| 3 | Create immigration page | High | High | Compelling story, zero competition |
| 4 | Create endorsements page | High | Medium | Andy Kim endorsement should surface everywhere |
| 5 | Update news/press section | High | Medium | Shows campaign is active, provides fresh content |
| 6 | Update Ballotpedia | Medium | Medium | Direct submission allowed |
| 7 | Claim Knowledge Panel | Medium | Medium | Can suggest edits once claimed |
| 8 | Wikipedia Talk page | Low | High | High impact but slow, uncertain process |

## Fix: Specific Actions

### Critical Priority: Create Ethics FAQ Page

**Why This Matters:** When voters ask "Is Tom Malinowski honest?", AI has no campaign source to cite. The only sources discussing ethics are news articles about the violations—not the resolution.

**Squarespace Instructions:**

1. Go to **Pages** → Click `+` → **Blank Page**
2. Name: `Ethics & Transparency` → URL slug: `ethics`
3. Add **Text Block** with Q&A format addressing:
   - Stock disclosure timeline and resolution
   - Blind trust establishment (July 2021)
   - STOCK Act reform co-sponsorship
   - House Ethics Committee outcome
4. **SEO tab** → Title: `Ethics & Transparency | Tom Malinowski for Congress`
5. Meta Description: `Tom Malinowski established a blind trust and co-sponsored the Ban Conflicted Trading Act. Learn about his commitment to ethics reform and transparency in Congress.`

**Key Messages to Include:**

- Blind trust established July 2021 to avoid any appearance of conflict
- Co-sponsored the Ban Conflicted Trading Act to ban congressional stock trading
- House Ethics Committee reviewed and closed the matter
- Supports strongest possible ethics reforms for Congress

### Critical Priority: Update Homepage SEO

**Why This Matters:** Google's Knowledge Graph doesn't know Malinowski is running in 2026. The homepage title and meta description are the campaign's strongest signals to search engines.

**Squarespace Instructions:**

1. Go to **Pages** → Click on your **Home** page
2. Click the **gear icon** (Page Settings) → **SEO** tab
3. Update SEO Title to: `Tom Malinowski for Congress | NJ-11 Democratic Candidate 2026`
4. Update Meta Description to: `Tom Malinowski is running for Congress in New Jersey's 11th District. Former Assistant Secretary of State, human rights advocate, endorsed by Senator Andy Kim. Primary: February 5, 2026.`
5. Click **Save**

**Also Add Schema Markup:**

1. Go to **Settings** → **Advanced** → **Code Injection**
2. In the **Header** field, paste:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Tom Malinowski",
  "jobTitle": "Candidate for U.S. Congress, NJ-11",
  "description": "Democratic candidate for New Jersey's 11th Congressional District special election, February 2026. Former Assistant Secretary of State and Human Rights Watch advocacy director.",
  "affiliation": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Democratic Party"
  }
}
</script>
```

### High Priority: Create Immigration Page

**Why This Matters:** Malinowski fled Communist Poland at age 6—a uniquely compelling story. But AI can't answer questions about his immigration stance because no page exists.

**Content to Include:**

- Personal story: fled Poland at age 6 with mother
- Human Rights Watch refugee work
- Congressional record on immigration
- DACA position
- Family separation opposition

### High Priority: Create Endorsements Page

**Why This Matters:** The Andy Kim endorsement should surface consistently across all AI platforms. Platforms that check the official website find no endorsements page.

**Content to Include:**

- Andy Kim endorsement with quote
- Morris County Democratic Committee
- Organized labor endorsements
- Community leader endorsements

### Third-Party Platforms

**Google Knowledge Panel:**

1. Search "Tom Malinowski" on Google
2. On the Knowledge Panel, click **"Claim this knowledge panel"**
3. Verify ownership through Google's process
4. Once verified, suggest edits to description, photo, and social links

**Wikipedia:**

- **Do NOT** directly edit the article (conflict of interest policy)
- **Do NOT** pay anyone to edit
- **CAN** post on the Talk page requesting corrections with reliable sources
- **CAN** ensure press coverage is accurate (Wikipedia editors cite news)

**Ballotpedia:**

- Complete the **Candidate Connection** survey
- Submit biographical updates through their official process
- Ballotpedia actively welcomes candidate participation

## Voter Reach & Impact

### How Many Voters Research Candidates Online?

The majority of voters now use the internet to research candidates before voting:

- **62% of voters** use the internet to research candidates and political issues (Pew Research, 2024)
- **40-45% of Google searches** now show AI Overviews at the top of results
- **100M+ weekly users** use ChatGPT in the US, with political research a growing use case
- **Younger voters over-index:** 73% of voters under 50 research candidates online vs. 48% of voters over 50

### Estimated Impact: NJ-11

Applying these trends to the NJ-11 special election:

| Metric | Estimate | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| NJ-11 Registered Voters | ~500,000 | Total registered |
| Expected Primary Turnout | 60,000-80,000 | Democratic primary, special election |
| Voters Who Research Online | ~37,000-50,000 | 62% of likely primary voters |
| Voters Who See AI Results | ~15,000-22,000 | ~40-45% encounter AI Overview or ChatGPT |
| **Voters Potentially Influenced** | **1,500-4,400** | 10-20% of those who see improved AI responses |

**What This Means:** If the campaign implements these fixes, an estimated **1,500 to 4,400 primary voters** will see accurate, favorable information about Malinowski instead of ethics violations as the lead story. In a competitive primary, this margin can be decisive.

### Cost Comparison: AI Fixes vs. Paid Media

Moving voter opinions through traditional advertising is expensive—especially in the New York/New Jersey media market:

| Method | Cost to Move 2,000 Voters | Notes |
|--------|---------------------------|-------|
| TV Advertising (NY/NJ Market) | $200,000-$400,000 | $100-200 per persuaded voter |
| Digital Advertising | $100,000-$200,000 | $50-100 per persuaded voter |
| Direct Mail | $80,000-$150,000 | $40-75 per persuaded voter |
| **AI Presence Optimization** | **$5,000-$15,000** | Website updates + monitoring |

**The Math:** Traditional advertising costs **$50-200 per voter moved**. Fixing AI presence costs a fraction of that and reaches voters at the moment they're actively researching—when they're most persuadable. A campaign spending $300,000 on TV ads to fix a reputation problem could achieve similar results by spending $10,000 on website improvements and AI monitoring.

**Important caveat:** These estimates are based on available research and reasonable assumptions. Actual impact will vary based on race competitiveness, voter engagement, and implementation effectiveness.

## Methodology

### How This Report Was Produced

This report was produced using four Kyanos tools:

- **Panopticon** — AI Monitoring & Remediation. Queries AI surfaces with questions voters actually ask, traces errors to root causes, ranks issues by impact, and delivers CMS-specific instructions.

- **Tripwire** — Opponent Website Monitoring. Watches competitor websites for changes and alerts when opponents shift messaging.

- **Bentham** — Extraction Infrastructure. The shared engine that powers all Kyanos products. Runs AI queries at scale across platforms with geographic variation.

- **AdWatch** — Political Ad Intelligence. Monitors ads across Google and Meta transparency libraries. Tracks opponent spend and classifies ad tone.

### Query Sourcing

We test the questions voters actually ask—not questions we imagine they might ask:

- **Google Autocomplete** — We start with what Google suggests when voters type the candidate's name. These suggestions reflect actual search behavior.

- **Reddit & Discord** *(Coming Soon)* — Analysis of political discussions to identify emerging topics before they show up in search data.

- **Campaign-Requested Prompts** *(Coming Soon)* — Campaigns can request monitoring of specific questions they're hearing on the ground.

### Platform Coverage

**Primary Platforms:** Google AI Overview and ChatGPT

These two platforms represent the dominant surfaces where voters encounter AI-generated political information. Our experience shows that improving Google + ChatGPT creates improvements that propagate to other platforms.

**Additional Platforms Available:** Perplexity, Gemini, Bing Copilot, Claude

**Coming Soon:** Meta AI (as a proxy for WhatsApp, where we cannot yet monitor mobile-only surfaces)
