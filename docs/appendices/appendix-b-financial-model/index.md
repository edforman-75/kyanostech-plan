# Appendix B: Financial Model & Unit Economics

## Executive Summary

Our financial model supports the dual objectives of **mission impact** and **sustainable operations**.  
Key assumptions include:

- **Revenue:** $6.4M gross target in the 2028 presidential cycle, built from conservative penetration rates across 259 customers.  
- **Net Revenue:** ~$5.76M after VAR commissions.  
- **Gross Profit:** ~$4.8M (75% margin) after direct operating costs.  
- **Profitability:** Approaching break-even in 2028, ensuring the ability to operate beyond the cycle without perpetual fundraising.

## Revenue Model Build-Up

Revenue is derived from the segmentation detailed in Appendix A. The conservative penetration model yields a **$7.075M gross total**, which is then adjusted to a **$6.4M operational target** to account for cushion and conservative assumptions.

| Year | Customers | Gross Revenue | VAR Commissions | Net Revenue | Direct Costs | Gross Profit |
|------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| 2026 | 35        | $659,000      | $66,000         | $593,000    | $150,000     | $443,000     |
| 2027 | 100+      | $2,800,000    | $280,000        | $2,520,000  | $560,000     | $1,960,000   |
| 2028 | 259       | $6,400,000    | $640,000        | $5,760,000  | $960,000     | $4,800,000   |

> **Note:** Figures are rounded, net of VAR partner commissions (avg. 10–25%), with direct costs pegged at ~15% of net revenue.[^3]

## Unit Economics

**Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):**  
- Assumes 2-cycle (4-year) average customer lifespan.  
- Average annual gross fee per customer: $24.7K.  
- LTV: ~$50K per customer.  

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**  
- Blended across direct and VAR channels.  
- CAC: ~$7K per customer by 2028.[^5]  
- **LTV/CAC Ratio:** ~7.0 (healthy SaaS benchmark is 3–5).  

**Margins:**  
- Gross Margin: 75% by 2028.  
- Operating Margin: still slightly negative until 2028; approaching break-even at year-end.

## Detailed Expense Forecast

The expense model is aligned with the Financial Plan and scales with growth, emphasizing engineering, campaign success, and compliance.

| Category                  | 2026 | %   | 2027 | %   | 2028 | %   |
|---------------------------|------|-----|------|-----|------|-----|
| Exec Comp (CEO, CTO, CCO) | 600K | 43% | 650K | 21% | 700K | 10% |
| Engineering / R&D         | 300K | 21% | 1,000K | 33% | 2,300K | 33% |
| Sales & Marketing         | 200K | 14% | 550K | 18% | 600K | 9%  |
| Customer Success          | 100K | 7%  | 300K | 10% | 1,500K | 22% |
| G&A (rent, laptops, admin)| 150K | 11% | 430K | 14% | 1,350K | 19% |
| **Total OPEX**            | 1,350K | 100% | 2,930K | 100% | 6,450K | 100% |

> **Observation:** In 2028, one-third of OPEX goes to engineering, another one-fifth to customer success — confirming strategic focus on technology and campaign support. Benefits, travel, and laptop expenditures are embedded in these categories.[^7][^8][^9]

## Breakeven & Runway

- **Breakeven:** Approaching by year-end 2028; modest net loss possible depending on cost scaling.  
- **Funding Needs:**  
  - Seed (2025): $500K  
  - Series A (2026): $2.5M  
  - Convertible Debt (2028): $2.0M  

This staged approach ensures capital availability at election-cycle peaks while minimizing dilution.

## Key Takeaways

- The **$6.4M gross revenue target in 2028** is achievable under conservative penetration assumptions and aligned across all plan sections.  
- **Breakeven consistency:** Financial Plan, Exit Strategy, and this appendix now all reflect “approaching break-even in 2028.”  
- Strong **unit economics** (75% gross margin, 7× LTV/CAC) support long-term sustainability.  
- Sensitivity tests confirm resilience under varying adoption and pricing scenarios.
