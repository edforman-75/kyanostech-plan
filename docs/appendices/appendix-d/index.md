## Funding Pathways

To achieve the projected impact in the 2028 cycle, KyanosTech must raise **$5M in external funding** beyond product revenue. Potential sources include:

- **Equity Investment:** Progressive family offices, impact venture capital, and high-net-worth individuals who align with the mission.  
- **Debt Financing:** Mission-aligned lenders or revenue-based financing to supplement equity.  
- **Grants (via sibling nonprofit):** Foundations and movement infrastructure funders could support R&D or shared infrastructure (particularly SCOPE). Grants cannot flow directly into a for-profit.  
- **Hybrid Approach:** A dual entity allows simultaneous equity and grant funding — but increases governance and compliance costs.

## Single vs. Dual Structures

**Single-Entity Model (B-Corp only):**  
- **Advantages:** Simplest to govern, fastest path to full funding, easiest for private investors to understand.  
- **Constraints:** Limited ability to receive grants or PAC support directly. PAC contributions must flow through candidate committees (see Appendix I).  

**Dual-Entity Model (B-Corp + sibling nonprofit):**  
- **Advantages:** Unlocks grant and nonprofit funding streams, allows PACs and foundations to support infrastructure (e.g., SCOPE).  
- **Constraints:** Significant compliance overhead, requires strict firewalls, and risks management distraction from 2028 goals.

  <strong>Compliance note:</strong> Organizational form does not change campaign finance law. Whether structured as a B-Corp, LLC, or hybrid, KyanosTech must follow the same FEC rules for who can pay for AGON, POLIS, and SCOPE. See Appendix I – Campaign Finance Compliance Framework.

## Path Forward

KyanosTech will maintain **flexibility** while signaling clarity to investors:

- **Most expeditious path:** Raise the full $5M into the B-Corp. This provides sufficient runway and minimizes governance and compliance overhead.  
- **Contingent option:** If substantial foundation or PAC-aligned funding emerges, establish a **sibling nonprofit** dedicated to infrastructure (e.g., SCOPE) while keeping AGON and POLIS in the B-Corp.  
- **Guiding principle:** Complexity is a cost. Every additional entity adds legal, compliance, and management overhead. Overburdening the structure could impede execution of the 2028 strategy.

  <strong>Big picture:</strong> Mission‑aligned governance can coexist with agility by choosing a form that embeds purpose while enabling growth.
