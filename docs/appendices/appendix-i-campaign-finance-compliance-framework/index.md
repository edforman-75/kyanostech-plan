# Appendix I – Campaign Finance Compliance Framework

<div style="border:1px solid #d1d5db; background-color:#f9fafb; padding:12px 16px; border-radius:8px; margin:16px 0;">
  This appendix explains how KyanosTech products can be sold to campaigns, officeholders, and PACs while complying with U.S. campaign finance law. The goal is clarity: what each product can do, who can legally pay for it, and what safeguards are required.
</div>

## Why Compliance Matters

Political technology vendors operate in one of the most regulated markets in the U.S. economy.  
The same tool can be legal or illegal depending on **who pays for it** and **how it is used**.  
Because KyanosTech is structured as a **B-Corp** (a for-profit entity with a public benefit mission), the company is bound by the same campaign finance rules as any other corporation.

  <strong>Big picture:</strong> Campaigns may pay directly at fair market value; PACs may contribute funds to campaigns (within limits); officeholders may use official budgets for official tools; and PACs or nonprofits may fund independent infrastructure that is not coordinated with candidates.

## AGON – Campaign Platform

**Purpose:** AGON supports campaign activity such as voter engagement, digital optimization, and election-cycle communication.  

**Who Pays:** Candidate committees, state party committees, and national party committees.  

**Legal Rules:**  
- Campaigns must pay directly at the *usual and normal charge*.¹  
- PACs can contribute funds to campaigns (within FEC limits), but **the campaign—not the PAC—must be the contracting party** with KyanosTech.²  
- Discounts must be uniformly available (published or generally offered), not selective “sweetheart deals” for favored candidates.³

## POLIS – Officeholder Platform

**Purpose:** POLIS is designed for incumbents in government office to support official communications, constituent services, and legislative transparency.  

**Who Pays:** Congressional budgets (House MRAs, Senate SOPOEAs), or state officeholder budgets.  

**Legal Rules:**  
- Official resources cannot be used for campaign activity.⁴  
- PACs cannot subsidize POLIS for officeholders — this would be treated as a prohibited gift or contribution.⁵  
- POLIS must be clearly marketed and delivered as an **official-use-only tool**, with no crossover into campaign operations.

## SCOPE – Verification & Monitoring Platform

**Purpose:** SCOPE tracks AI bias, misinformation, and visibility across platforms. It serves both campaigns and the broader Democratic movement.  

**Who Pays:**  
- Campaigns, if the output is **candidate-specific**.  
- PACs or 501(c)(4) organizations, if SCOPE is used for **general monitoring or infrastructure** (not coordinated with a candidate).  

**Legal Rules:**  
- Candidate-specific SCOPE deployments must be purchased directly by the campaign at fair market value.⁶  
- PACs or nonprofits may fund general SCOPE dashboards, reports, or monitoring that is made broadly available (i.e., infrastructure, not coordination).⁷  
- Independent expenditures must remain independent: no private sharing of SCOPE results with campaigns if funded by a Super PAC.

## Firewalls & Safeguards

- **Separate contracts:** Each product must be sold under a contract with the correct paying entity (campaign, officeholder, PAC, or nonprofit).  
- **Fair pricing:** Rates must be market-based and consistently applied to avoid “in-kind” contribution risk.  
- **Internal firewalls:** Data and strategies for campaigns cannot flow into PAC-funded or nonprofit-funded deployments of SCOPE.  
- **Transparency:** Disclose product boundaries in investor materials to preempt compliance questions.

  <strong>Critical risk:</strong> Mixing campaign, officeholder, and PAC/nonprofit funding streams without strict contractual and data firewalls could be deemed illegal coordination. Compliance must be operationalized from day one.

## Footnotes

¹ **Usual and Normal Charge:** FEC definition of in-kind contributions, 11 CFR 100.52(d)(1).  
² **PAC-to-Campaign Contributions:** Campaigns must purchase services directly; PACs may provide contributions, but vendors cannot accept PAC funds on behalf of a campaign. (FEC Advisory Opinion 2011-12, Democracy Engine)  
³ **Discounting Rules:** Selective discounts to some candidates but not others can be treated as in-kind contributions. (FEC Advisory Opinion 2004-06, MeetUp)  
⁴ **Official Resources:** House Ethics Manual (2023), “Use of official funds and staff,” pp. 122–126; Senate Ethics Manual, Chapter 6.  
⁵ **Prohibited Gifts:** Campaign finance restrictions treat PAC-funded software/services for officeholders as gifts, which are barred. (House Ethics Manual, Chapter 2)  
⁶ **Candidate-Specific Services:** Advisory Opinion 2014-06 (Ryan, PACs, and vendors), clarifying campaign-specific services must be billed directly to campaigns.  
⁷ **Independent Expenditures:** FEC rules on coordination, 11 CFR 109.21; Advisory Opinion 2011-12 (Democracy Engine), permitting infrastructure platforms funded by PACs if not coordinated with campaigns.
