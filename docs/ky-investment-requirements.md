## Investment Structure

Kyanos is structured as a **non-profit mission-driven organization**, offering:

- **Mission lock**: Charter prevents mission drift
- **Downside protection**: Tax-deductible contributions
- **Transparency**: Clear reporting on fund deployment and outcomes
- **Precedent**: Same model as Catalist ($1M Soros seed, now serves every major Democratic campaign)

---

## Critical Timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| March 15, 2026 | Funding committed (enables hiring) |
| April 15, 2026 | Funds in bank (payroll starts) |
| June 2026 | Team operational, founding cohort begins |
| Q1 2027 | Grant 2 secured, paid pricing activates |
| Q1 2028 | Cash-flow positive |

**If delayed past Q2 2026:** Miss 2026 cycle, severely compromise 2028 position.

---

## Catalist Precedent

Catalist demonstrates this model works:

- **Founded:** 2006
- **Initial funding:** $1M from George Soros; $4M+ from Tides Foundation
- **Structure:** Mission-driven organization
- **Today:** Serves virtually every major Democratic campaign
- **Lesson:** Foundation funding creates permanent progressive infrastructure

The success of Kyanos will depend on forward-looking progressive investments and the efforts of our team.
