| **Minimum** | $750,000 |
| **Reach** | $1,250,000 |
| **Timeline** | Commitments by March 15, 2026 |

### Why $1M Is Enough

Six months ago, a smaller product portfolio would have required 5x the capital to reach the 2028 cycle. AI-assisted development has fundamentally changed the economics. A small team using modern AI tools can build and operate what would have taken a much larger team just two years ago.

Kyanos is built with the same AI capabilities we help campaigns leverage—we practice what we preach. In a sense, the rapid progress of AI plays a critical role in both the problem and the solution.

## Why Fund Kyanos?

### The Problem

- Voters increasingly get political information from AI
- AI systems may misrepresent progressive candidates
- No progressive infrastructure exists to monitor or remediate
- Platforms face pressure from hostile administration

### The Solution

- Kyanos monitors AI representation of progressive candidates
- Traces errors to root causes
- Provides actionable fixes campaigns can implement
- Documents evidence of platform bias

### The Opportunity

- First mover in progressive AI monitoring
- Trust structure prevents capture or sale
- Catalist-style infrastructure play
- 2026 is critical timing for 2028 presidential cycle

### The Alternative

Without Kyanos, progressives cede the AI information space to:

- Platform algorithms without accountability
- Conservative-optimized content
- Hallucinations and misinformation
- No systematic monitoring or remediation

## Catalist Precedent

Catalist demonstrates this model works:

- **Founded:** 2006
- **Initial funding:** $1M from George Soros; $4M+ from Tides Foundation
- **Structure:** Trust-owned LLC
- **Today:** Serves virtually every major Democratic campaign
- **Lesson:** Foundation funding creates permanent progressive infrastructure
