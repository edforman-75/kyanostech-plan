# Two Scares That Reshape 2026–2028

<!-- cross-ref: Executive_Summary, Problem_and_Urgency, Market_Financial_Opportunity -->

## The Next Media Revolution: From Podcasts to AI Chatbots

Democrats underestimated the power of podcasts in the 2020–24 cycle. While progressive groups dabbled, the right built entire networks, captured millions of loyal listeners, and used the medium to define news cycles and reinforce narratives with little counterweight. The result was asymmetric reach: Democrats were late, Republicans had a running start, and the medium became a structural advantage.

We cannot afford to repeat that mistake.

Just as podcasts reshaped the 2020–24 political landscape, AI chatbots are poised to become the transformational medium of 2026 and 2028. The shift is already underway: information discovery is moving away from links and clicks, and toward answers delivered directly inside AI systems — whether through Google’s AI Overviews, Amazon’s Alexa+, or the next-generation Siri and ChatGPT-style assistants embedded in every phone and browser.

This change is faster, broader, and more consequential than the podcast wave because the infrastructure is already in place — hundreds of millions of Americans already use these assistants daily. By the time voters are making choices in 2028, nearly half (and possibly more) of all voter information queries will be answered inside AI environments, not on campaign websites.

## Scare 1 — AI Is the Next Podcast (And We're About to Miss It Again)

In 2024, progressives dismissed podcasts as entertainment for young men. Meanwhile, conservatives built an ecosystem that reached millions of persuadable voters every week. By the time we took it seriously, we were years behind.

**AI is following the same pattern.** Right now, most campaigns treat AI as a curiosity—something the tech team might mention, not something the campaign manager prioritizes. That's exactly how we treated podcasts in 2020.

But the data shows AI is already reshaping how voters get information:

- **58.5% of Google searches** now end without a click (SparkToro/Similarweb, 2024). Voters get their answer from AI and never visit a campaign website.
- **50% of Google queries** show AI Overviews at the top of results—before any links.
- **AI chat is growing fast:** 5.6% of desktop search traffic in July 2025, more than double year-over-year. Among information-seeking tasks, the share is higher.

And it's not just browsers. **Amazon's Alexa+** launched in February 2025 as a Prime-bundled AI assistant, rolling out to millions of devices. Apple is preparing a smarter Siri with generative capabilities. AI is moving into kitchens, cars, and living rooms—places campaigns have never had to compete.

### The Persuasion Gap

Here's what makes this urgent: **AI isn't just reaching voters. It's moving them—more effectively than any medium we've ever measured.**

Landmark studies published in *[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09771-9)* and *[Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aea3884)* (December 2025) by MIT's David Rand and Cornell's Gordon Pennycook quantified AI's persuasive power:

- **In the 2024 U.S. election:** A pro-Harris AI chatbot moved Trump supporters **3.9 points** on a 100-point scale — roughly **4 times the measured effect** of political advertisements in 2016 and 2020.
- **In Canadian and Polish elections:** AI chatbots achieved shifts of **~10 percentage points** among opposition voters.
- **When optimized for persuasion:** AI achieved opinion shifts of up to **25 percentage points**.

This is not a marginal effect. AI chatbots are the **most persuasive political communication channel ever measured** in controlled experiments.

Most users will never click a link, even if one is offered. They will be satisfied with what the search results or chatbot tells them.

Here's what campaigns need to understand: **both browsers and AI systems cite the sources they can find.** It's not magic. It's not algorithmic mystery. If your website has good content, organized well, that's what voters see. If it doesn't, they see whatever else is out there—opponent framing, outdated news, or errors.

The mission of the candidate website is being transformed: less a destination for voters, and more the **source material that search engines and AI systems draw from** when voters research.

### Why This Creates Opportunity

Here's the good news: **AI presence can be optimized at low cost, and it makes a campaign's entire media strategy more effective.**

Think about what happens when a campaign's media works. A voter sees a TV ad or digital campaign. They're interested. What do they do next? They Google the candidate. They ask ChatGPT.

If AI gives them bad information—outdated facts, opponent framing, ethics controversies—that media spend is wasted. The voter's positive impression disappears the moment they research.

**AI optimization protects media investment.** It ensures that when advertising drives voters to research, they find information that reinforces the campaign's message. Every dollar spent on TV, digital, and mail becomes more effective.

And it costs almost nothing:

| Investment | Cost per Voter Influenced |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Broadcast TV | $100-600 |
| Digital Advertising | $50-100 |
| **AI Presence Optimization** | **$1-10** |

AI optimization is the highest-leverage line item in any media plan—it amplifies everything else.

## 2028 Estimate: How Many Voter Queries Will AI Answer?

We estimate that by the November 2028 general election, **~45–60% of voter information queries** will be answered inside AI experiences (AI Overviews or chat) rather than via clicks to official or campaign sites.

**Assumptions (conservative, documented):**  
- AI Overviews coverage: From ~50–55% in 2025 to 55–60% by 2028 .  
- AIO “satisfaction” rate (user gets enough info to avoid a click): ~60–70% for political info queries (definition-style and comparison queries that Overviews serve well).  
- Chatbot share of search events (cross-device): From ~5.6% in 2025 to ~15–20% by 2028 .  

**Computation (union probability, accounting for overlap):**  
Let A = AIO_coverage × AIO_satisfaction; B = chatbot share.  
- Base case: A = 0.58 × 0.65 ≈ 0.38; B = 0.18; assume 30% overlap → union ≈ 0.38 + 0.18 − (0.30 × 0.18) ≈ 0.50 (50%).  
- Range: With low/high bounds on AIO and chat growth plus overlap, we get **~45–60%**.

We will lock this estimate down with pilot data in 2026–27 using repeated, stratified prompts and human-rated "satisfaction to click" audits.

## Scare 2 — Structural Pressure on AI Platforms

AI development is concentrated among a small number of companies—and those companies face intense pressure from an administration that has shown willingness to punish perceived disloyalty.

This is not about the intentions of tech leaders. Many are personally progressive. Many have donated generously to Democratic causes and candidates. The concern is structural: even well-intentioned companies face pressure points that could influence AI behavior in ways that disadvantage progressives.

### The Pressure Points

- **Market concentration:** A handful of companies control the major AI platforms voters will use. Microsoft partners exclusively with OpenAI; Amazon and Google have invested billions in Anthropic; Meta distributes Llama at platform scale. This concentration means decisions made by a few actors affect what hundreds of millions of voters see.

- **Government contract exposure:** The Department of Defense's JWCC is a $9B multi-vendor contract; the intelligence community's C2E is a 15-year, "tens of billions" multi-cloud deal. These are material revenue streams that create leverage for any administration willing to use it.

- **Regulatory vulnerability:** The current administration has demonstrated willingness to pressure companies on content decisions. In 2020, the White House attempted to reshape platform liability via executive order and pressed the FCC on Section 230 rulemaking. Tech companies face ongoing antitrust scrutiny, spectrum decisions, and merger reviews where political considerations can influence outcomes.

### Why This Matters

The issue is not that tech leaders want to help MAGA. The issue is that **responsible corporate governance requires managing political risk**—and in the current environment, that risk runs in one direction.

A general counsel advising a public company might reasonably say: "We can't afford to be seen as hostile to the administration. Let's err on the side of caution." That caution—applied to AI training, content policy, or model behavior—could systematically disadvantage progressive candidates and causes.

This is why **external monitoring matters**. Campaigns and the progressive movement cannot rely on platforms to self-police. We need independent visibility into how AI systems represent political topics—and the ability to sound the alarm if something changes.

**Kyanos provides that watchdog function.** We monitor AI platforms continuously, detect shifts in how they represent progressive candidates and issues, and document changes. If models move against progressives—whether through intentional decision or algorithmic drift—we'll know first.
