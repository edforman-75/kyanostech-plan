# Two Scares That Reshape 2026–2028

## The Next Media Revolution: From Podcasts to AI Chatbots

Democrats underestimated the power of podcasts in the 2020–24 cycle. While progressive groups dabbled, the right built entire networks, captured millions of loyal listeners, and used the medium to define news cycles and reinforce narratives with little counterweight. The result was asymmetric reach: Democrats were late, Republicans had a running start, and the medium became a structural advantage.

We cannot afford to repeat that mistake.

Just as podcasts reshaped the 2020–24 political landscape, AI chatbots are poised to become the transformational medium of 2026 and 2028. The shift is already underway: information discovery is moving away from links and clicks, and toward answers delivered directly inside AI systems — whether through Google’s AI Overviews, Amazon’s Alexa+, or the next-generation Siri and ChatGPT-style assistants embedded in every phone and browser.

This change is faster, broader, and more consequential than the podcast wave because the infrastructure is already in place — hundreds of millions of Americans already use these assistants daily. By the time voters are making choices in 2028, nearly half (and possibly more) of all voter information queries will be answered inside AI environments, not on campaign websites.

## Scare 1 — AI Becomes the Gatekeeper of Voter Information

Voters’ “search” behavior is shifting from clicking links to receiving answers directly from AI systems. Independent tracking shows a material rise in “zero-click” behavior, where users get what they need without visiting a website. SparkToro’s 2024 analysis of Similarweb panel data found **58.5%** of U.S. Google searches ended without a click . Other panels show lower but rising figures (e.g., **27.2% zero-click in March 2025**) , underscoring different methodologies but the same directional trend.

Google’s **AI Overviews** further compress clicks by answer-boxing results. In 2025, Pew’s field data observed that a majority of users encountered at least one AI Overview in March , and multiple industry trackers now estimate Overviews appear on roughly **50% of queries** .

Dedicated **AI chat experiences** are also capturing share. In July 2025, Datos/PYMNTS measured AI chat at **5.6% of desktop, browser-based search traffic**, more than double year-over-year . While still a minority, the growth rate is steep and concentrated among information-seeking tasks.

This shift is not limited to the browser. **Amazon’s Alexa+** launched in February 2025 as a Prime-bundled, generative-AI assistant, now rolling out to “many millions” of devices . Apple is preparing a smarter Siri with generative capabilities, embedding conversational AI in every iPhone. These in-situ assistants move voter questions into kitchens, cars, and living rooms — far from the campaign websites that once mediated information flow.

### Why This Matters for Democracy

Small, nontransparent tweaks to training data, safety constitutions, or reward models can meaningfully change how systems summarize political topics — often without leaving an audit trail visible to campaigns or the public. Research shows:

1. Alignment methods such as **RLHF** (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), **RLAIF** (from AI Feedback), and **Constitutional AI** deliberately shape model behavior .  
2. Large Language Models (LLMs) already show **measurable political leanings** in benchmark tests.  
3. LLMs can be highly **persuasive on political questions**, raising stakes for even small nudges .

Most users will never click a link, even if one is offered. They will be satisfied with what the chatbot says. The mission of the candidate and officeholder website is therefore being transformed: less a destination for voters, and more the **mechanism by which the chatbots are trained**.

## 2028 Estimate: How Many Voter Queries Will AI Answer?

We estimate that by the November 2028 general election, **~45–60% of voter information queries** will be answered inside AI experiences (AI Overviews or chat) rather than via clicks to official or campaign sites.

**Assumptions (conservative, documented):**  
- AI Overviews coverage: From ~50–55% in 2025 to 55–60% by 2028 .  
- AIO “satisfaction” rate (user gets enough info to avoid a click): ~60–70% for political info queries (definition-style and comparison queries that Overviews serve well).  
- Chatbot share of search events (cross-device): From ~5.6% in 2025 to ~15–20% by 2028 .  

**Computation (union probability, accounting for overlap):**  
Let A = AIO_coverage × AIO_satisfaction; B = chatbot share.  
- Base case: A = 0.58 × 0.65 ≈ 0.38; B = 0.18; assume 30% overlap → union ≈ 0.38 + 0.18 − (0.30 × 0.18) ≈ 0.50 (50%).  
- Range: With low/high bounds on AIO and chat growth plus overlap, we get **~45–60%**.

We will lock this estimate down with pilot data in 2026–27 using repeated, stratified prompts and human-rated “satisfaction to click” audits.

## Scare 2 — AI Distribution Concentrated Among Tech Oligarchs

A small group of firms owns or exclusively supplies the leading AI assistants and models — and they also depend heavily on federal contracts and regulatory goodwill. That doesn’t prove intentional bias toward Trump and MAGA, but it does create **obvious pressure points**.

- **Control / capital stack:** Microsoft is OpenAI’s exclusive cloud partner; Amazon invested $4B+ in Anthropic and made AWS its primary cloud; Google has also invested billions into Anthropic; Meta distributes Llama at platform scale. These actors effectively control the chips, clouds, models, and consumer assistants most voters will use .  
- **Federal cloud leverage:** The Department of Defense’s JWCC is a $9B multi-vendor contract, with billions already in task orders; the intelligence community’s C2E is a 15-year, “tens of billions” multi-cloud contract. AWS, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle all compete — revenue no board can risk .  
- **Regulatory precedent:** In 2020, the White House attempted to reshape platform liability via executive order and pressed the FCC to consider Section 230 rulemaking — illustrating willingness to pressure independent agencies on content .

**Takeaway:** Even if Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, or others do not intend to favor MAGA, they face simultaneous incentives (major contracts, antitrust risk, regulatory exposure) that encourage **risk-averse choices** in AI defaults. Caution — not conspiracy — is the correct reading.
