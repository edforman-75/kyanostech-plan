# Market & Financial Opportunity

## 1. Urgency of Digital Discovery

The 2024 cycle underscored how quickly discovery has shifted from mass broadcast to online, structured channels. [^fn-mo-digital-share-28pct] Campaigns that failed to surface in Google, YouTube, TikTok, and emerging AI-driven discovery flows were effectively invisible to younger and persuadable voters. This was not about ad budgets but about the **schema, metadata, and compliance of digital infrastructure**.

Conservative campaigns and aligned organizations have historically invested more consistently in digital infrastructure, sustaining platform-native audiences and benefiting from higher algorithmic amplification. Progressive campaigns, by contrast, have often relied on legacy CMS deployments and less structured digital tooling — creating lag in machine-readable content and discoverability. This pattern is suggested by available data but requires deeper comparative research and ongoing monitoring [^fn-discovery-gap].

The urgency is therefore existential: without discoverability, even well-funded campaigns risk being bypassed in the very contexts where voters are increasingly making decisions. Digital discovery has become a **defensive moat as well as an offensive growth driver**, and the failure to close this gap by 2026–28 risks compounding losses.

## 2. Market Definition

The relevant market is not campaign “ads” or general overhead — it is the **non-media digital infrastructure** that underpins discoverability. This includes:

Campaign **websites and CMS** deployments.
**Analytics and compliance tooling** required for disclosure and structured reporting.
**Schema-driven content systems** that allow campaigns to be surfaced in search engines, social platforms, and AI assistants.

These budgets remain small relative to overall campaign spending, but they are **growing faster than traditional media**. Historically, 3–5% of campaign budgets have been allocated to technology and SaaS-style tools — a conservative benchmark we use for total addressable market (TAM) [^fn-mo-total-political-12b-2024] [^fn-mo-method-2].

### Market Funnel Overview

| Layer | Definition | 2026–28 Estimate | Notes / Sources |
|-------|------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **TAM** | Non-media digital/technology budgets of Democratic & Independent federal/state campaigns, committees, and officeholders | $600–800 M | Based on ~3–5% of campaign spend in SaaS/CMS/content tooling [^fn-mo-total-political-12b-2024] [^fn-mo-method-1] |
| **SAM** | Portion of TAM relevant to AI-discovery tools and structured data systems | $20–40 M | Conservative allocation based on tool specificity [^fn-mo-method-3] |
| **SOM** | Attainable market via platform integration (limited CMS support + top-race targeting) | $30–50 M | Our internal estimate, based on early SaaS adoption patterns; subject to verification [^fn-mo-method-4] |

This framing is intentionally conservative: it excludes paid media, does not count campaign travel or staffing, and narrows the relevant spend to digital systems where schema compliance and AI-discoverability matter most.

## 3. Growth Dynamics

Three dynamics reinforce why the opportunity is timely and expanding:

1. **Digital Dominance.** The Wesleyan Media Project reported that in late-cycle 2024, digital ad spend ($23M) achieved near parity with TV ($24.5M) [^fn-mo-method-1] [^fn-mo-digital-tv-parity]. While these numbers reflect ads, they serve as context: the competitive battlefield is shifting online, and campaigns without robust digital infrastructure risk irrelevance.

2. **Technology Budget Expansion.** Campaigns are migrating more resources into digital infrastructure, including structured data, compliance systems, and schema-enabled CMS deployments. These investments are increasingly seen not as optional but as **mission-critical**.

3. **Cyclical Uptake with Recurrence.** Like all political spend, demand peaks in presidential cycles and dips in off-years. However, we expect **recurring revenue flows** from officeholders and committees (who maintain compliance and discovery systems year‑round) to help flatten these troughs, enabling sustained ARR. This is a forecasted assumption that should be validated with pilot data. We expect SOM-driven ARR to **peak in 2028** while maintaining a baseline through intervening years.

Taken together, these dynamics highlight a market that is **both growing and defendable**, with urgency driven by existential risk of invisibility and opportunity amplified by structural shifts in voter discovery.

[^fn-discovery-gap]: **Evidence base and monitoring need.** Tech for Campaigns’ *2024 Political Digital Advertising Report* documents Republican continuity in year-round infrastructure building versus Democrats’ sprint-style campaigns (2024). A multinational study of algorithmic amplification found the political right benefiting more often than the left in discoverability outcomes (2021, arXiv preprint 2110.11010). While neither source directly measures schema adoption or CMS modernization, together they suggest a systematic infrastructure advantage. Further research is required to quantify structured-data readiness and AI-discovery alignment across party lines, and this is an area we will continue to monitor.
