# Product Strategy & Technology

KyanosTech's product strategy is anchored in **three core products** ‚Äî **AGON, POLIS, and SCOPE** ‚Äî and in the development of an **open schema specification** for political information.[^1] Together, these products form a closed-loop system: campaigns and committees publish structured, authoritative data; outputs are continuously monitored; and insights feed back into content creation and optimization. This cycle ensures Democratic visibility in AI-mediated information discovery.



## Guiding Principles

- **üî¨ Validation First:** Before full-scale development, KyanosTech will validate assumptions through extensive campaign and partner interviews, technology deep dives, and lean pilots.[^2] To the extent our understanding of customer and channel needs shifts ‚Äî or the opportunities the technology supports expand ‚Äî our **roadmap and business plan will evolve**.

- **üîÑ Continuous Learning:** SCOPE data closes the loop by monitoring what works across campaigns, documenting best practices, and feeding them back into AGON and POLIS.[^3] Over time, this establishes a durable **learning system** that compounds competitive advantage.

- **üõ°Ô∏è Compliance & Trust:** POLIS meets the requirements of official .gov sites and Congressional CMS platforms.[^4] Strict separation between B-Corp and 501(c) arms will be validated by outside counsel to protect against election law violations.[^5]

## Schema Specification: Building the Political Layer of the Web

Current schema.org standards inadequately cover political actors and contexts.[^12] KyanosTech will **develop and steward an open schema specification** enabling structured, authoritative publication of:

- Candidate biographies, issue positions, and endorsements
- Legislative activity, roll-call votes, and public statements
- Election events, deadlines, and voter access information
- The underlying **logic and evidence** behind policy positions
- A wide set of communication deliverables typically found on political websites

**Why this matters:** AI training engines compare schema markup (in web source code) with narrative site content.[^13] If the two are not aligned, the site will not be treated as a credible source.[^14] By defining and applying schemas across campaigns and officeholders, KyanosTech has the opportunity to set the standard ‚Äî creating a long-term Democratic competitive advantage.
