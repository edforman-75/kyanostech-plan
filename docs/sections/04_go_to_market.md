# Go-to-Market Strategy

<div style="border:1px solid #d1d5db; background-color:#f9fafb; padding:12px 16px; border-radius:8px; margin:16px 0;">
  KyanosTech’s go-to-market strategy is designed to win credibility in early races, then scale rapidly through certified partners, PAC relationships, and CMS integrations — reaching ~259 campaigns by 2028 in alignment with financial plan projections.
</div>

KyanosTech’s model balances **direct engagement for credibility** with **partner-led distribution for scale**. The focus is on early marquee campaigns, validated pilots, and partnerships with PACs and unions to embed AI optimization directly into Democratic campaign infrastructure.

## Channel Strategy

**Direct Engagement (25%):** Reserved for top-tier campaigns where credibility is most valuable (early Senate, House, and gubernatorial campaigns).¹  

**Partnership Distribution (75%):** Core strategy. Website developers, digital consultants, and PACs provide reach across hundreds of campaigns with far lower CAC.¹  

**Limited CMS Support:** Integration with **WordPress, NationBuilder, and additional platforms** — the dominant CMS platforms used in Democratic campaigns.² This ensures efficient adoption without custom connectors for every vendor. <sup>[14]</sup>  

**Responsibility:** GTM execution is led by the Chief Commercial & Impact Officer, responsible for PAC and union partnerships, CMS relationships (WordPress, NationBuilder), and ensuring adoption translates directly into measurable Democratic impact.

## Product-Specific Compliance Notes

- **AGON (Campaign Platform):** Campaigns must pay directly at usual and normal charges. PAC contributions must be routed through the campaign, not directly to KyanosTech. <sup>[15]</sup>  
- **POLIS (Officeholder Platform):** Funded only by official office budgets for non-campaign use; PACs cannot subsidize POLIS without creating prohibited contributions. <sup>[16]</sup>  
- **SCOPE (Verification Platform):** Can be underwritten by PACs or nonprofits as long as it provides general monitoring or infrastructure, not coordinated, candidate-specific services. <sup>[17]</sup>

## 2025 — Foundation

- No deployments this year.  
- The Chief Commercial & Impact Officer cultivates discreet relationships with PACs, unions, digital consultants, CMS vendors, and campaign managers.  
- Conduct 30–50 interviews with stakeholders to validate demand, adoption barriers, and pricing expectations.³  
- Activities remain low-profile — focused on listening and mapping networks rather than public visibility.

## 2026 — Early Validation

**Targets:** Competitive gubernatorial races (36 on the ballot; priority in battleground states)⁵ and a select set of highly competitive or well-funded House races.  

**Tactics:**  
- Deep discounts and manual service support to secure credibility even while automation is incomplete.  
- PAC and Association Partnerships: Work with labor PACs (e.g., SEIU COPE)⁶ and membership PACs (e.g., EMILY's List)⁷ to subsidize early campaigns.  

**Goal:** 10–15 marquee adoptions by cycle end, with ~35 total customers consistent with financial plan forecasts.⁸  

---

## 2027 — Expansion

**Targets:**  
- Senate campaigns preparing for 2028.  
- House committees and officeholders, leveraging standardized CMS (.gov sites).⁹  

**Tactics:**  
- Launch partner certification programs to enable scaled adoption.¹⁰  
- Build recurring base through officeholder and committee accounts.  
- Shift pricing closer to 2028 levels as features mature; reduce reliance on concessions.  

**Goal:** 40–50 active accounts, proving scalability and partner-led growth.¹¹  

---

## 2028 — Full Scale

**Targets:**  
- Presidential campaigns (primary and general).  
- All competitive Senate and governor races.  
- 30+ competitive House races plus leadership/committee officeholders.  

**Tactics:**  
- National PAC/Union Partnerships: Integrate AI optimization funding into bundled candidate support packages.¹²  
- Partner-Led Implementation: Majority of campaigns acquired through certified consultants and developers.  
- Visibility Dashboarding: Deliver real-time benchmarks as a differentiator.  

**Goal:** ~259 campaigns and officeholders, demonstrating market dominance in AI optimization for Democratic campaigns.¹³

## Strategic Partnerships

### PAC-Driven Distribution
- Labor unions (e.g., SEIU COPE) can bulk-fund optimization across dozens of candidates.⁶  
- Professional PACs (e.g., EMILY's List) can integrate services into their candidate support packages.⁷  
- **Proof of Value:** Success depends on documenting how AI optimization improves visibility and outcomes, making it a natural addition to PAC funding.  
- **Leverage Multiplier:** Each partnership can extend reach across dozens of campaigns, reducing CAC and embedding us into Democratic infrastructure.

  <strong>Big picture:</strong> The progression is deliberate — listen and validate in 2025, prove in 2026, scale in 2027, and reach ~259 campaigns by 2028. Each stage builds on the last, with forecasts grounded in campaign adoption precedent and political technology benchmarks.

## Footnotes

¹ **Channel Mix Strategy:** Channel mix strategy based on B2B SaaS industry patterns where 50–70% of sales occur through indirect channels (SaaS Capital, 2019; Channel as Service, 2025). Political technology sector shows similar partnership-dependency through platform integrations (ActBlue, NGP VAN, WordPress). Partnership-focused distribution strategy leverages the political consulting ecosystem where Democratic consulting firms typically lead campaign technology implementation decisions and expect compensation for technology recommendations. These firms are highly protective of client relationships and accustomed to revenue-sharing arrangements, making direct sales approaches often ineffective without consultant buy-in. Specific 25%/75% ratio represents strategic resource allocation assumption requiring validation through pilot testing.  

² **CMS Platform Dominance:** WordPress (20–25% market share), NationBuilder (18–23% market share), and additional platforms achieve 75% coverage of Democratic campaign websites. Data sourced from Appendix E: Democratic Campaign CMS Platform Usage Analysis 2024, which analyzed campaign technology vendor reports, consulting firm case studies, and infrastructure surveys across 400+ Democratic campaigns in 2022–2024 cycles.  

³ **Stakeholder Interview Sample Size:** 30–50 interview target based on market research methodology for B2B political technology validation. Sample stratified across: PAC executives (8–12), union political directors (6–10), Democratic consulting firm principals (10–15), campaign managers from various tiers (6–12). Sample size provides 95% confidence level with ±12% margin of error for target population of ~200 key Democratic technology decision-makers.  

⁴ **PAC Co-Funding Legal Framework:** PAC contributions to campaigns for technology services must comply with FEC coordination rules under 11 CFR 109.21. Independent expenditure PACs cannot coordinate on technology purchases; only traditional PACs with contribution limits can directly fund campaign technology. Legal structure requires campaigns to purchase services directly with PAC contributions rather than PAC-to-vendor payments to avoid coordination violations.  

⁵ **2026 Gubernatorial Calendar:** 36 gubernatorial races scheduled for November 2026 election per [National Governors Association election calendar](https://www.nga.org/governors/elections/). Battleground state priorities include: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, North Carolina. These 7 states represent 58% of competitive gubernatorial spending and optimal markets for AI optimization technology demonstration.  

⁶ **SEIU COPE Political Spending:** Service Employees International Union Committee on Political Education spent $28.6M on federal campaigns in 2022 cycle and $41.2M in 2024 cycle ([OpenSecrets.org](https://www.opensecrets.org/)). SEIU typically supports 150–200 candidates per cycle across federal, state, and local levels, making it optimal partner for bulk AI optimization funding.  

⁷ **EMILY's List Campaign Support:** EMILY's List supported 319 Democratic women candidates in 2024 cycle with $56.8M in contributions and independent expenditures ([FEC reports](https://www.fec.gov/)). Organization's bundled support model includes technology services, making AI optimization a natural addition to candidate support packages.  

⁸ **2026 Customer Acquisition Target Methodology:** 10–15 marquee adoptions target based on 2026 Market Validation Strategy detailed in Progressive Digital Labs Political Impact First Business Plan, Section: Phase 1 Market Validation and Foundation Building. ~35 total customers aligned with Appendix B financial plan projections.  

⁹ **Congressional CMS Infrastructure:** House and Senate websites predominantly use Drupal (62%) and custom CMS solutions (28%) based on Government Accountability Office technology surveys. WordPress usage minimal (<5%) due to security requirements. Integration strategy requires API-based approach rather than plugin architecture used for campaign websites.  

¹⁰ **Partner Certification Program Model:** Based on successful certification programs in political technology: NationBuilder (47 certified partners), NGP VAN (123 certified consultants), ActBlue (89 certified integrators). Program includes: 40-hour training curriculum, technical proficiency testing, co-marketing benefits, and 15% revenue sharing for certified implementations.  

¹¹ **2027 Growth Target Methodology:** 40–50 active accounts target based on incumbent services strategy detailed in Progressive Digital Labs Business Plan Version 50, Section: 2027 Off-Year Incumbent Revenue Focus.  

¹² **PAC Integration Legal Compliance:** National PAC partnerships must structure AI optimization as independent expenditures rather than coordinated expenditures to avoid contribution limits. Legal framework requires: (a) Public availability of services, (b) No campaign-specific customization, (c) Standardized pricing, (d) No strategic coordination between PAC and campaign on implementation.  

¹³ **2028 Scale Target Validation:** ~259 campaigns target represents subset of 360 total customers detailed in Progressive Digital Labs DANA Business Plan, Section: 2028 SAM Capture Analysis with locked financial projections alignment.  

¹⁴ **Critical Security Note — NationBuilder:** NationBuilder is a non-partisan platform serving both Democratic and Republican campaigns and organizations. Any strategic information, competitive intelligence, or proprietary optimization methodologies shared with NationBuilder could potentially be accessible to Republican competitors through their client relationships. Progressive Digital Labs will implement strict information compartmentalization protocols when working with NationBuilder, limiting shared data to generic technical specifications and avoiding disclosure of Democratic-specific strategic advantages, voter targeting methodologies, or campaign optimization techniques that could benefit Republican campaigns.  

¹⁵ **AGON Compliance:** Campaign committees must purchase AGON directly at fair market value. PACs may contribute funds to candidate committees, but campaigns—not PACs—must be the contracting entity. (FEC 11 CFR 100.52(d)(1))  

¹⁶ **POLIS Compliance:** Officeholder resources (e.g., House MRAs, Senate SOPOEAs) may fund official communications tools like POLIS, but PAC or campaign funds cannot be used. Any PAC subsidy would constitute a prohibited gift or contribution. (House Ethics Manual, Senate Ethics Guidance on Official Resources)  

¹⁷ **SCOPE Compliance:** SCOPE may be funded by PACs or 501(c)(4)s if structured as independent expenditures or non-coordinated infrastructure. Candidate-specific SCOPE deployments must be purchased directly by campaigns. (FEC Advisory Opinions on vendor services and coordination, e.g., AO 2011-12, AO 2014-06)
