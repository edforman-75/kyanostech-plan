# ðŸ‘¥ Team & Governance

## Governance Structure

KyanosTech will be organized as a **Certified B Corporation**, balancing mission and profit.[^fn-bcorp] This structure ensures:  
- **Mission alignment**: Embeds democratic impact into the legal DNA of the company.  
- **Investor access**: Allows us to raise growth capital without compromising values.  
- **Compliance flexibility**: Affiliated nonprofit and PAC entities will be established as needed to comply with FEC and IRS regulations, particularly 501(c)3/501(c)4 distinctions.  

This hybrid approach mirrors successful models in progressive infrastructure where legal firewalls must coexist with coordinated strategy.[^fn-bcorp]

## Board & Oversight

The board is designed to balance investor confidence with mission integrity:[^fn-board]  
- **Composition**: Investor representatives, independent directors, and mission guardians.  
- **Annual mission audit**: Conducted by a third-party to ensure impact metrics remain central.  
- **Compensation alignment**: Equity, options, and leadership incentives will be tied to both financial and impact milestones, not one at the expense of the other.  

This ensures accountability on two fronts: protecting democracy and delivering sustainable economics.[^fn-board]

## Executive Team

## Talent Strategy

- **Hybrid team model**: Core leadership and policy staff will be based near our **Metro DC offices**, ensuring proximity to campaigns and committees. Engineering and customer success talent will be drawn from **across the U.S. and globally**, giving us access to the best talent wherever it resides.  
- **Engineering focus**: Recruit engineers with AI/ML, schema, and campaign-tech backgrounds. The CTO will directly oversee software development and integrations.  
- **Partnership leverage**: Collaborations with academic labs and digital agencies expand capacity beyond internal hires.  
- **Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)**: We will track DEI benchmarks in hiring and retain advisors to ensure the team reflects the constituencies we serve.[^fn-dei]  
- **Election-cycle scalability**: Permanent headcount is capped for off-year sustainability. Support is expanded through VARs and contractors during peak cycles.

## Culture & Values

- **Mission-first**: Democracy protection through resilient, discoverable digital infrastructure.  
- **Transparency**: Open reporting on finances, governance, and impact metrics.  
- **Resilience**: Governance and staffing model explicitly built for election cycles, with sustainability in off-years.  
- **No layoffs of permanent staff**: Contractors absorb surges, ensuring stability and institutional memory.  
- **Cohesion in a distributed world**: While staff will be based both near DC and around the world, we will hold **in-person meetups every eight weeks**. These gatherings strengthen team culture, enforce accountability, and create the bonds needed for mission-driven work.

## Footnotes

[^fn-bcorp]: Certified B Corporations are for-profit companies legally required to consider impact on workers, customers, communities, and the environment. This structure has been successfully adopted by mission-driven organizations such as Patagonia and is increasingly used in impact-focused technology startups.
[^fn-board]: Best practices in political/civic tech governance recommend boards that combine **investor oversight** with **mission guardianship** to avoid capture by short-term financial interests (e.g., hybrid nonprofit/for-profit models, independent directors, and annual mission audits).
[^fn-dei]: Research consistently shows diverse teams improve strategic reach and innovation capacity (e.g., McKinsey & Company, *Diversity Wins: How Inclusion Matters*, 2020).
