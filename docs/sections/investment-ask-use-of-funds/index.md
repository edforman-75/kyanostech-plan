| Series A   | 2026       | $4.5M      | Expand engineering, compliance, and sales; establish VAR partnerships; invest in customer success. |
| Convertible Debt | 2028 | $2M        | Sustain operations through the 2028 federal election cycle, provide runway into 2029, preserve optionality for future capital or exit. |

| General & Administrative (G&A) | ~15%           | Leadership, operations, compliance, DC office footprint, bi-monthly in-person team meetups. |

## Investor Value Proposition

<div style="border-left: 6px solid #0b5fff; background: #f5f8ff; padding: 1rem 1.25rem; border-radius: 6px; margin: 1rem 0;">
  <h3 style="margin: 0 0 .5rem 0;">Investor Value Proposition</h3>
  <ul style="margin: 0 0 .5rem 1.25rem;">
    <li><strong>Mission + Return</strong> â€” Back a venture that strengthens democracy while building a SaaS business with durable economics.</li>
    <li><strong>Proven Milestones</strong> â€” Staged capital tied to measurable adoption and impact metrics; disciplined use of funds across product, customer success, and distribution.</li>
    <li><strong>Exit Optionality</strong> â€” Multiple paths: acquisition by an aligned technology/political-infrastructure firm, nonprofit spinout, or profitable growth as a standalone Bâ€‘Corp.</li>
    <li><strong>Cycle-Ready Resilience</strong> â€” Allocation and reserves sized for election-year surges and offâ€‘year sustainability, preserving talent and momentum.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="margin: 0;">Bottom line: this raise funds a defensible platform (schema + integrations + benchmarks) and a distribution engine (VARs + training) designed to convert credibility into revenue and measurable impact.</p>
</div>

This plan links staged capital to milestones[^fn-staged], aligns allocation with SaaS norms[^fn-saas-norms], and preserves multiple exit paths[^fn-exit].
