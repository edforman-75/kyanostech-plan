## 1. Urgency of Digital Discovery

The 2024 cycle underscored how quickly discovery has shifted from mass broadcast to online, structured channels. [^fn-mo-digital-share-28pct] Campaigns that failed to surface in Google, YouTube, TikTok, and emerging AI-driven discovery flows were effectively invisible to younger and persuadable voters. This was not about ad budgets but about the **schema, metadata, and compliance of digital infrastructure**.

Conservative campaigns and aligned organizations have historically invested more consistently in digital infrastructure, sustaining platform-native audiences and benefiting from higher algorithmic amplification. Progressive campaigns, by contrast, have often relied on legacy CMS deployments and less structured digital tooling — creating lag in machine-readable content and discoverability. This pattern is suggested by available data but requires deeper comparative research and ongoing monitoring [^fn-discovery-gap].

The urgency is therefore existential: without discoverability, even well-funded campaigns risk being bypassed in the very contexts where voters are increasingly making decisions. Digital discovery has become a **defensive moat as well as an offensive growth driver**, and the failure to close this gap by 2026–28 risks compounding losses.

## 2. Market Definition

The relevant market is not campaign “ads” or general overhead — it is the **non-media digital infrastructure** that underpins discoverability. This includes:

Campaign **websites and CMS** deployments.
**Analytics and compliance tooling** required for disclosure and structured reporting.
**Schema-driven content systems** that allow campaigns to be surfaced in search engines, social platforms, and AI assistants.

These budgets remain small relative to overall campaign spending, but they are **growing faster than traditional media**. Historically, 3–5% of campaign budgets have been allocated to technology and SaaS-style tools — a conservative benchmark we use for total addressable market (TAM) [^fn-mo-total-political-12b-2024] [^fn-mo-method-2].

### Market Funnel Overview

| Layer | Definition | 2026–28 Estimate | Notes / Sources |
|-------|------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **TAM** | Non-media digital/technology budgets of Democratic & Independent federal/state campaigns, committees, and officeholders | $600–800 M | Based on ~3–5% of campaign spend in SaaS/CMS/content tooling [^fn-mo-total-political-12b-2024] [^fn-mo-method-1] |
| **SAM** | Portion of TAM relevant to AI-discovery tools and structured data systems | $20–40 M | Conservative allocation based on tool specificity [^fn-mo-method-3] |
| **SOM** | Attainable market via platform integration (limited CMS support + top-race targeting) | $30–50 M | Our internal estimate, based on early SaaS adoption patterns; subject to verification [^fn-mo-method-4] |

This framing is intentionally conservative: it excludes paid media, does not count campaign travel or staffing, and narrows the relevant spend to digital systems where schema compliance and AI-discoverability matter most.

## 3. Growth Dynamics

Three dynamics reinforce why the opportunity is timely and expanding:

1. **Digital Dominance.** The Wesleyan Media Project reported that in late-cycle 2024, digital ad spend ($23M) achieved near parity with TV ($24.5M) [^fn-mo-method-1] [^fn-mo-digital-tv-parity]. While these numbers reflect ads, they serve as context: the competitive battlefield is shifting online, and campaigns without robust digital infrastructure risk irrelevance.

2. **Technology Budget Expansion.** Campaigns are migrating more resources into digital infrastructure, including structured data, compliance systems, and schema-enabled CMS deployments. These investments are increasingly seen not as optional but as **mission-critical**.

3. **Cyclical Uptake with Recurrence.** Like all political spend, demand peaks in presidential cycles and dips in off-years. However, we expect **recurring revenue flows** from officeholders and committees (who maintain compliance and discovery systems year‑round) to help flatten these troughs, enabling sustained ARR. This is a forecasted assumption that should be validated with pilot data. We expect SOM-driven ARR to **peak in 2028** while maintaining a baseline through intervening years.

Taken together, these dynamics highlight a market that is **both growing and defendable**, with urgency driven by existential risk of invisibility and opportunity amplified by structural shifts in voter discovery.
