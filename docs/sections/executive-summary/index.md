# Executive Summary

KyanosTech exists to solve a clear and urgent problem: **AI systems are rapidly becoming the front door to political information, and Democrats are at risk of falling behind**. Conservative-aligned actors are already investing in tools and narratives to tilt these new information channels. If Democratic campaigns do not move quickly, they risk losing not just an election cycle, but a generation of voter influence.

**Our answer is infrastructure, not advertising.** KyanosTech provides AI-optimized visibility for Democratic campaigns, committees, and officeholders. By ensuring Democratic candidates appear prominently, accurately, and persuasively in AI-driven answers, we protect the information battlefield while giving campaigns a tangible competitive edge.

<strong>Key takeaway:</strong> AI will reshape democratic discourse as profoundly as television and social media did before. Democrats have an estimated 18–24 months to secure their footing before the 2028 cycle reaches critical intensity. See the evidence and timing discussion in Appendix F.

## The Case for Investment

- **Market Size:** ~$6.4M revenue opportunity in 2028 built from ~259 Democratic campaigns, committees, and officeholders. [^1]  
- **Business Model:** High-margin SaaS with a blended ~90% net revenue retention after partner commissions. [^2]  
- **Strategic Moat:** Proprietary schema libraries, verification/monitoring (SCOPE), and distribution via certified developers, consultants, and PAC partnerships that make replication difficult.  
- **Funding Ask:** **$5M** now to complete product, GTM, and compliance scaling on the runway to 2028. A fully funded B-Corp is the most expeditious path, with an option to add a nonprofit sibling for SCOPE if grant opportunities warrant. [^3]  

## Roadmap to 2028

- **2025 – Foundation:** Quiet relationship-building and validation with PACs, unions, consultants, and CMS partners; structured discovery to de-risk adoption and pricing.  
- **2026 – Proof:** Credibility pilots in competitive gubernatorial and House races; one-time concessions to secure marquee references; early PAC/association distribution.  
- **2027 – Expansion:** Entry into Senate and committee/officeholder markets; standardized partner certification; growing recurring base.  
- **2028 – Scale:** Presidential adoption; coverage across competitive Senate/Governor races and targeted House districts; 250–300+ entities served through partner-led implementations.
