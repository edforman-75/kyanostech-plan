# Business Model & Unit Economics

We structure the business model using the Strategyzer Business Model Canvas (BMC)[^fn-bm-strategyzer]. [^fn-bm-competitor-pricing]  
All elements below are initial assumptions; during the SEED phase, we will conduct further research, expert interviews, and partner validation to substantiate the model.

---

## 1. Customer Segments
- Democratic campaigns (Presidential, Senate, House).  
- Democratic committees (DNC, DSCC, DCCC, state parties).  
- Officeholder committees (incumbent Members of Congress).  
- Independent-aligned campaigns and committees (case-by-case).  

---

## 2. Value Propositions
- **Visibility in AI search:** Ensures Democratic facts, values, and positions are discoverable in AI assistants.  
- **Compliance & security:** Meets .gov and FEC requirements.  
- **Productivity:** Reduces staff time via structured authoring, grammar/style support.  
- **Accountability:** Continuous benchmarking/audit trail supports litigation, press, and public trust.  

---

## 3. Channels
- Direct sales to national committees and large campaigns.  
- Partnerships with Democratic digital agencies.  
- Limited CMS support (WordPress, Drupal/GovCMS) for distribution (see *CMS Landscape Briefing* for detail).  
- SEED phase pilots to build reference customers.  

---

## 4. Customer Relationships
- White-glove onboarding (early years).  
- Transition to scalable SaaS self-service by 2027–2028.  
- Ongoing customer success + training for campaign staff.  

---

## 5. Revenue Streams
- SaaS subscription tiers:  
  - **AGON** (campaign) – $1,500–$3,000/month depending on race size [^fn-bm-pricing-plans].  
  - **POLIS** (officeholder) – $1,000–$2,000/month [^fn-bm-pricing-plans].  
- Early services revenue (schema setup, training, audits).  
- Custom pilots (presidential campaigns, congressional committees).  

---

## 6. Key Resources
- Proprietary schema library and AI benchmarking system.  
- Engineering team (schema, AI/ML, integrations).  
- Policy/legal advisors for compliance.  
- Partnerships with campaign committees and agencies.  

---

## 7. Key Activities
- Continuous schema development and updates.  
- Benchmark testing and reporting.  
- Customer onboarding + training.  
- Security and compliance audits.  

---

## 8. Key Partnerships
- Democratic committees (DNC, DSCC, DCCC).  
- Academic institutions (methodology, bias research).  
- Agencies providing campaign digital services.  
- CMS providers (WordPress, Drupal/GovCMS).  

---

## 9. Cost Structure
- Heavy R&D in early years (schema, SCOPE platform, AI testing).  
- Services staff (onboarding, setup) in 2025–2026.  
- Transition to SaaS-dominant margins (>70%) by 2028 [^fn-bm-margins-2028].  
- Estimated ARR by 2028: **~$4.2M**, with durable SaaS retention [^fn-bm-arr-2028].  

Given significant operating, product development, and customer acquisition costs, achieving cash-flow break-even in 2028 depends on hitting both our revenue targets and our gross-margin goals.

## 10. Unit Economics

In business planning, two key metrics help investors and operators understand sustainability: **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** and **Lifetime Value (LTV).**

- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**  
  This is the total cost of winning a new customer account. For us, it includes **sales staff time, marketing/outreach spend, onboarding services, and compliance/security work** required to set up a campaign or committee on the platform.  
  - Estimated at **$40K–60K** per top-tier campaign in early years, reflecting heavy white-glove onboarding [^fn-bm-cac].  
  - Expected to fall to ~$25K by 2028 as onboarding becomes standardized, partnerships mature, and automation improves.

- **Lifetime Value (LTV):**  
  This is the total revenue we expect to earn from a customer account across its entire relationship with us. For us, it includes **subscription revenue from AGON and POLIS plans, services revenue in early years, and renewals across multiple election cycles**.  
  - Estimated at **$200K–250K** per account, assuming multi-cycle retention and year-round contracts with officeholders/committees [^fn-bm-ltv].

- **LTV:CAC Ratio:**  
  A shorthand way to measure return on investment in customer acquisition. If CAC is the “cost of entry,” LTV is the “return,” and the ratio tells us whether growth is efficient.  
  - Our target is **4–5x by 2028**, consistent with healthy SaaS companies [^fn-bm-ltv-cac].

- **Gross Margin Trajectory:**  
  - 2025–2026: 55–60% (services-heavy onboarding).  
  - 2027: ~65% (transition to SaaS).  
  - 2028: 70–75%+ (SaaS dominant) [^fn-bm-margins-2028].

- **Break-even 2028:**  
  ARR of ~$30M (≈300 campaigns) matches or slightly exceeds OPEX of ~$25–28M, achieving cash-flow neutrality [^fn-bm-breakeven].

**Key Levers to Achieve Unit Economics Targets:**  
- CAC reduction through **channel partnerships**, **standardized onboarding**, and **automation** of schema setup.  
- LTV growth through **multi-cycle renewals**, **upsell of compliance/reporting modules**, and **year-round officeholder/committee contracts**.  
- **Training and support of partners, and development of effective training materials**, will be critical to reducing CAC and maximizing LTV.  
- **Strong account management** to maintain long-term customer relationships and ensure repeat renewals.  
- Margin expansion by shifting from **services-heavy early years** to **SaaS-dominant ARR** by 2028.  
- Continuous benchmarking of CAC and LTV against SaaS norms to refine assumptions, with **pilot validation in SEED phase**.

[^fn-bm-margins-2028]: **Gross margin benchmarks.** Mature B2B SaaS commonly sustains >75%. KeyBanc/OpenView survey ~73% average (ex-sub-$5M GAAP revenue). Chargebee overview: <https://www.chargebee.com/resources/glossaries/saas-gross-margin/>. Bessemer benchmarks show top performers ($1–10M ARR) reaching ~85%: <https://www.bvp.com/atlas/scaling-to-100-million>.

[^fn-bm-arr-2028]: **ARR estimate (~$4.2M by 2028).** Derived from AGON ($1.5–3.0k/mo) and POLIS ($1.0–2.0k/mo) pricing × expected account counts and ramp. This is a modeled assumption; requires validation in SEED phase.

[^fn-bm-cac]: **Customer Acquisition Cost.** Modeled assumption benchmarked to enterprise SaaS with complex onboarding. Estimate of $40–60K early, declining to ~$25K by 2028. Requires validation with pilot data.

[^fn-bm-ltv]: **Lifetime Value.** Modeled assumption based on SaaS retention patterns. Estimate of $200–250K assumes retention across multiple election cycles and off-cycle continuity. Requires validation in SEED phase.

[^fn-bm-ltv-cac]: **LTV:CAC ratio.** SaaS best practice is ≥3x. Targeting 4–5x by 2028 aligns with OpenView SaaS benchmarks (<https://openviewpartners.com/blog/ltv-cac-ratio/>).

[^fn-bm-breakeven]: **Break-even 2028.** Modeled assumption: ARR of ~$30M (≈300 campaigns) covers ~$25–28M OPEX. Requires validation as CAC, LTV, and gross margin trajectory mature.
