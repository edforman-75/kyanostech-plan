# SLIDE 1: TITLE

## Kyanos
### Keeping Progressives Visible in the AI Era

*Making sure voters find the truth about progressive candidates*

**Ed Forman, Founder**
January 2026

---

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"Thanasi, thank you for your time. I reached out to Investing In US because you understand something most political operatives don't: the next communication revolution isn't coming—it's already here.

You and Reid founded Investing In US on the thesis that technology changes politics faster than politics adapts. That's exactly what's happening with AI.

Kyanos is the infrastructure play for progressive politics in the AI era. I want to show you why this belongs in your portfolio."

**TRANSITION TO SLIDE 2:**

"Let me start with a lesson we should have learned in 2024..."

---

# SLIDE 2: THE PODCAST MISTAKE

## We Missed Podcasts. AI Is Next.

In 2020, progressives dismissed podcasts as entertainment for young men.

Meanwhile, conservatives built an ecosystem that reached millions of persuadable voters every week.

By the time we took it seriously, we were **years behind**.

### The Pattern Repeats

| 2020-2024 | 2024-2028 |
|-----------|-----------|
| Podcasts | AI Chatbots |
| Joe Rogan, Lex Fridman | Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, WhatsApp AI |
| 3-hour conversations | Instant answers to voter questions |
| Progressives arrived late | **We have a chance to lead** |

---

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"You watched this happen. Joe Rogan's endorsement of Trump reached 14 million people in a single episode. Progressives had no equivalent infrastructure.

The same pattern is emerging with AI. Right now, most campaigns treat AI as a curiosity—something the tech team might mention, not something the campaign manager prioritizes.

That's exactly how we treated podcasts in 2020."

**TRANSITION TO SLIDE 3:**

"But AI isn't just another podcast moment. The data shows it's more consequential..."

---

# SLIDE 3: THE AI INFORMATION REVOLUTION

## By 2028, AI Will Answer Half of All Voter Queries

| Metric | Today | 2028 Projection |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Google searches ending without a click | 58.5% | 65%+ |
| Google queries showing AI Overviews | 50% | 60%+ |
| ChatGPT weekly US users | 100M+ | 200M+ |
| **Voter queries answered by AI** | ~30% | **45-60%** |

### What Matters Right Now

- **Google AI Overviews** - appears before any links, 50% of queries
- **ChatGPT** - 100M+ weekly US users actively researching
- **WhatsApp AI** - critical channel for Hispanic communities

### The Trend Is Clear

- Amazon's Alexa+ launched February 2025 (Prime-bundled)
- Apple partnering with Google for AI capabilities
- Voice AI coming to kitchens, cars, living rooms

**When voters research a candidate, AI answers first.**

---

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"This isn't about some future scenario. 58% of Google searches already end without a click—voters get their answer from AI Overviews and never visit a campaign website.

By the time voters are making choices in 2028, nearly half of all political information queries will be answered inside AI environments, not on campaign websites.

The mission of the candidate website has transformed. It's no longer primarily a destination for voters—it's the source material that AI systems draw from when voters research."

**TRANSITION TO SLIDE 4:**

"And here's what makes this urgent: AI isn't just reaching voters. It's moving them—more effectively than any medium we've ever measured..."

---

# SLIDE 4: THE RESEARCH

## AI Is 4x More Persuasive Than Television

### December 2025: Landmark Studies in *Nature* and *Science*

Research by MIT's David Rand and Cornell's Gordon Pennycook:

| Finding | Effect Size |
|---------|-------------|
| Pro-Harris AI chatbot moved Trump supporters | **3.9 points** on 100-point scale |
| Compared to TV advertising effect (2016/2020) | **4x larger** |
| Canadian and Polish elections | **~10 percentage points** shift |
| AI optimized for persuasion | Up to **25 percentage points** |

> "This is a shockingly large effect... especially in the context of presidential politics."
> — David Rand, MIT

### Meanwhile, Traditional Contact Has Near-Zero Effect

Kalla & Broockman (2018), meta-analysis of 49 field experiments:

> "The best estimate of the effects of campaign contact and advertising on Americans' candidate choices in general elections is **zero**."

---

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"Thanasi, this is peer-reviewed research from the world's most prestigious scientific journals, published just last month.

AI chatbots are the most persuasive political communication channel ever measured in controlled experiments. Four times more effective than television advertising.

And the beauty of Internet Presence Optimization: it costs a fraction of TV. We're talking $1-10 per voter influenced, compared to $100-600 for broadcast television.

This isn't just about keeping pace. It's about finding a lever that actually works when traditional contact doesn't."

**TRANSITION TO SLIDE 5:**

"But there's another dimension to this that I know you've been thinking about..."

---

# SLIDE 5: THE PLATFORM RISK

## AI Platforms Face Structural Pressure

### The Concentration Problem

A handful of companies control the major AI platforms voters will use:

- Microsoft partners exclusively with OpenAI
- Amazon and Google have invested billions in Anthropic
- Meta distributes Llama at platform scale

### The Leverage Points

| Pressure | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Government contracts | DoD JWCC: $9B multi-vendor; IC C2E: tens of billions |
| Regulatory exposure | Antitrust, Section 230, merger reviews, spectrum |
| Political pressure | Administration demands loyalty from tech CEOs |

### The Risk

This isn't about tech leaders' intentions—many are personally progressive.

The issue is **structural**: responsible corporate governance requires managing political risk. In the current environment, that risk runs in one direction.

A general counsel might reasonably say: *"We can't afford to be seen as hostile to the administration. Let's err on the side of caution."*

**That caution, applied to AI behavior, could systematically disadvantage progressives.**

---

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"You know these companies better than I do. You know the pressures they face.

I'm not suggesting bad faith. I'm suggesting that the incentive structures are misaligned. When an administration is willing to punish perceived disloyalty—and when companies have billions in government contracts at stake—caution has a political direction.

That's why external monitoring matters. Campaigns and the progressive movement can't rely on platforms to self-police. We need independent visibility into how AI systems represent political topics—and the ability to sound the alarm if something changes.

Kyanos provides that watchdog function."

**TRANSITION TO SLIDE 6:**

"So what exactly are we building?"

---

# SLIDE 6: THE SOLUTION

## Kyanos: Monitor, Diagnose, Fix

A family of AI-driven services that help progressive campaigns manage their digital presence.

### What We Do

1. **Monitor** how AI systems represent progressive candidates
2. **Trace** errors to their root causes
3. **Diagnose** what's actually fixable
4. **Prescribe** specific actions campaigns can implement immediately

### What We Don't Do

- Tell campaigns what they "should have" done
- Generate reports that sit unread
- Recommend things outside their control

**We focus on what campaigns can change, then make sure it gets changed.**

### The Watchdog Role

- Continuous monitoring across platforms
- Geographic variation detection through WatchTower
- Evidence base of platform behavior over time
- **If models shift against progressives, we know first and sound the alarm**

---

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"The name Kyanos comes from the ancient Greek word for blue—the root of 'cyan.' We chose it because we're building something foundational: the infrastructure that keeps progressives visible in the AI era.

Our methodology is simple: Observe what AI says, Trace where it got that information, Diagnose the root cause, and Prescribe specific fixes.

We don't just hand over a report. We monitor execution, coach the team through implementation, and confirm when AI systems update their responses."

**TRANSITION TO SLIDE 7:**

"Let me show you how this works in practice..."

---

# SLIDE 7: HOW IT WORKS

## The Causality Chain Methodology

### Phase 1: Monitor

- Query three surfaces using our Bentham infrastructure:
  - **AI chatbots:** ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Grok, Meta AI
  - **AI-integrated search:** Google AI Overviews, Bing Copilot
  - **Traditional search results**
- Test questions voters actually ask about the candidate
- WatchTower detects geographic variation

**Deliverable:** Dashboard showing exactly what voters see

### Phase 2: Prioritize

- Trace errors to root causes (Wikipedia? News? Campaign site?)
- Rank issues by: **Voter Reach × Error Severity × Fixability**
- Focus only on things the campaign can change

**Deliverable:** Ranked priority list with root cause analysis

### Phase 3: Act

- Step-by-step instructions for each issue
- Tailored to the campaign's CMS (WordPress, Squarespace, NationBuilder)
- Targeted delivery: Approver gets strategy, Implementer gets specs
- Monitor execution and coach through completion

**Deliverable:** Action cards with numbered steps ready to execute

---

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"Here's a concrete example. ChatGPT says a candidate supports a policy they actually oppose. We don't just flag the error—we trace it.

Maybe it's a Wikipedia entry that needs correcting. Maybe it's a misquoted news article that's been indexed. Maybe the campaign's issues page is missing or poorly structured.

Then we tell the campaign exactly what needs to happen. The comms director gets the messaging guidance. The web developer gets the technical specs. We provide templates, code snippets, everything they need to execute.

And we don't walk away. We track implementation and confirm when AI systems update."

**TRANSITION TO SLIDE 8:**

"Beyond Panopticon, we have a complete set of product capabilities..."

---

# SLIDE 8: PRODUCT CAPABILITIES

## Five Capabilities, One Platform

| Capability | Function | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Panopticon** | Core AI monitoring and remediation | MVP+ |
| **GoodInk** | Positive press discovery for campaigns to feature | MVP |
| **AdWatch** | Political ad monitoring across Google and Meta | MVP |
| **TripWire** | Opponent website change detection | MVP |
| **PostWatch** | Social media monitoring (YouTube, Bluesky, X) | MVP |

### WatchTower

Kyanos's distributed observation network for geographic monitoring.

- Detect regional variation in AI responses
- Identify geographic targeting or manipulation
- Essential for Statewide and National campaigns

### Bentham Infrastructure

The extraction engine powering all capabilities.

- Queries AI systems at scale
- Captures responses with full context
- Enables causality tracing across sources

---

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"Panopticon is the flagship—it's where campaigns see what AI says about them and get fixes.

GoodInk solves a different problem: campaigns often miss positive press coverage they could be featuring. We surface that automatically.

AdWatch monitors the political advertising landscape—what opponents are running, where, and how it's targeting voters.

TripWire watches opponent websites for changes. When they update their messaging or positions, campaigns know immediately.

All of this runs on Bentham, our extraction infrastructure. It's named after Jeremy Bentham, the philosopher who designed the original Panopticon."

**TRANSITION TO SLIDE 9:**

"Now let me explain how we've structured this to be permanent and accountable..."

---

# SLIDE 9: HOW WE OPERATE

## Trust-Owned. Mission-Locked. Sustainable.

### Structure

- **Trust entity** owns 100% of Kyanos LLC
- **Board of trustees** (3-5 progressive leaders) governs trust
- **Trust charter** locks in progressive-only service
- **Prevents hostile acquisition**—this infrastructure can never be sold to opponents

### Why Trust-Owned?

Follows the **Catalist precedent**—the voter file company that serves virtually every major Democratic campaign.

| Catalist | Founded 2006 |
|----------|--------------|
| Initial funding | $1M from George Soros; $4M+ from Tides Foundation |
| Structure | Trust-owned LLC |
| Today | Serves virtually every major Democratic campaign |

**The model is proven. Foundation funding creates permanent progressive infrastructure.**

### Revenue Model

- **2026:** Free access for 200 campaigns (building reference base)
- **2027:** Paid subscriptions launch, breakeven
- **2028:** $2.8M revenue, 466 clients, +$850K net

---

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"I know you've seen a lot of pitch decks. Most promise equity and exits. This is different.

We're not optimizing for an exit. We're building infrastructure that the progressive movement will rely on for decades. The trust structure ensures that.

Catalist proved this model works. They took foundation funding in 2006, built permanent infrastructure, and now serve virtually every major Democratic campaign. We're following the same playbook.

Your investment doesn't come with equity—there is no equity. What you get is a seat at the table for governance, and the knowledge that you helped build something permanent."

**TRANSITION TO SLIDE 10:**

"Here's the market we're going after..."

---

# SLIDE 10: MARKET & GO-TO-MARKET

## The Path to 466 Clients

### 2026: The Free Year (Foundation-Funded)

| Segment | Clients |
|---------|---------|
| Statewide | 15 |
| Congress | 50 |
| Local | 110 |
| Officeholders | 15 |
| Organizations | 10 |
| **Total** | **200** |

**Purpose:** Build reference base, case studies, testimonials

### 2027-2028: Paid Launch

| Year | Clients | Revenue | Net |
|------|---------|---------|-----|
| 2027 | 150 | $1.2M | Breakeven |
| 2028 | 466 | $2.8M | +$850K |

### Go-to-Market Strategy

- **Small local races:** Self-service, automated onboarding
- **Congress and up:** Through political consultants (channel partners)
- **PACs and committees:** Volume deals for endorsed candidates

**Consultants are the primary revenue channel**—they bring larger races with higher price points.

---

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"The 2026 free year is strategic. We're investing $330K of the raise to serve 200 campaigns at no cost. That builds our reference base and generates the case studies we need to sell in 2027.

The go-to-market is deliberately low-friction. Small campaigns get self-service—enter your info, system configures automatically. Larger campaigns come through consultants who already have trusted relationships.

By 2028, we project 466 clients and $2.8M in revenue. We're cash-flow positive by late 2027."

**TRANSITION TO SLIDE 11:**

"You're going to ask about competition..."

---

# SLIDE 11: COMPETITIVE POSITION

## First Mover in Progressive AI Monitoring

### The Landscape

| Category | Players | Our Position |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Generic SEO tools | SEMrush, Ahrefs, Moz | Not political, not AI-focused |
| AI monitoring | Mostly enterprise brand monitoring | Not political, not actionable |
| Political tech | NGP VAN, L2, Catalist | Different function—voter data, not AI presence |
| Progressive AI | **Kyanos** | **Only player focused here** |

### What Makes Us Different

1. **Political context:** We understand campaigns, not just keywords
2. **AI-native:** Optimized for AI answer generation, not just search ranking
3. **Causality focus:** We trace problems to root causes
4. **Actionable fixes:** We deliver solutions, not just reports
5. **CMS-aware:** Instructions match the campaign's actual tech stack
6. **Progressive-only:** Trust structure locks in mission alignment

### Network Effects

As we serve more campaigns:
- Better training data for our models
- More comprehensive competitive intelligence
- Stronger evidence for platform accountability

---

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"You'll notice there's no direct competitor. That's because the category doesn't exist yet.

SEO tools aren't built for AI. AI monitoring tools aren't built for politics. Political tech companies are focused on voter data, not AI presence.

We're the first mover in progressive AI monitoring, and our trust structure means we can't be acquired by someone who would use this against us.

The network effects matter here. Every campaign we serve makes our intelligence better. Every fix we implement teaches us more about how AI systems source information."

**TRANSITION TO SLIDE 12:**

"Let me introduce the team..."

---

# SLIDE 12: TEAM & GOVERNANCE

## Built for Permanence

### Founder

**Ed Forman** — 35 years of Silicon Valley experience. Early employee at eleven startups. MBA from Stanford, where he later taught entrepreneurship. Year in Ghana through Stanford's SEED program coaching companies across West Africa.

*Role: Architect and advisor. Assembling the team, framing the problem, designing the structure. Not taking an operational role.*

### Launch Team (Q2 2026)

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| CEO | Fundraising, foundation relationships, strategy |
| Technical Lead | Bentham infrastructure, product development |
| Research Director | Methodology, AI Bias Report, quality |
| Operations Manager | Study execution, client delivery |
| Marketing & Partnerships | Consultant relationships, sales |

### Board of Trustees

- Progressive movement leaders (mission fidelity)
- Foundation representatives (major funders with governance role)
- Labor representatives (union alignment)
- Independent expert (technology or political infrastructure)

---

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"I'm the architect, not the operator. My role is to assemble the team, frame the problem, and design a structure that outlasts any individual.

We'll hire a CEO with deep relationships in the progressive funding community. The technical lead will build Bentham and the product suite. Research director ensures methodology rigor.

The board of trustees governs the trust and ensures mission fidelity. Major funders get board seats—that's part of the value proposition for foundation investors."

**TRANSITION TO SLIDE 13:**

"Here's what we're asking for..."

---

# SLIDE 13: THE ASK

## $1,000,000 to Build Progressive AI Infrastructure

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Target** | $1,000,000 |
| **Minimum** | $750,000 |
| **Reach** | $1,250,000 |
| **Timeline** | Commitments by March 15, 2026 |

### Use of Funds

| Category | Amount | % |
|----------|--------|---|
| Personnel (5 FTEs) | $650,000 | 65% |
| Contractors | $150,000 | 15% |
| Infrastructure | $48,000 | 5% |
| Marketing/Events | $40,000 | 4% |
| Legal/Compliance | $25,000 | 3% |
| Operations | $22,000 | 2% |
| Reserve | $65,000 | 6% |

### What $1M Enables

- **Free 2026 access** for 200 campaigns (~$330K investment in reference base)
- **Core team** of 5 to build and operate the platform
- **Complete capability development** for Panopticon, GoodInk, AdWatch, TripWire, PostWatch
- **Self-sustaining by 2028** with +$850K annual surplus

---

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"We're asking for $1 million. That funds a full year of building and a free access program for 200 campaigns in 2026.

Why can $1 million do what would have taken $5 million a few years ago? AI-assisted development has fundamentally changed the economics. We practice what we preach—Kyanos is built with the same AI capabilities we help campaigns leverage.

The timeline is tight by design. We need commitments by March 15 to be operational by June and serving campaigns before the 2026 cycle heats up."

**TRANSITION TO SLIDE 14:**

"Let me tell you why I'm in this room specifically..."

---

# SLIDE 14: WHY INVESTING IN US

## This Is What You Were Built For

### Your Core Thesis—Applied to AI

> "Technology is changing politics faster than politics is adapting to technology."
> — Investing In US founding principle

**That's exactly what's happening with AI and voter information.**

- Political operatives don't understand AI
- Campaigns aren't adapting fast enough
- The infrastructure doesn't exist
- **Kyanos fills this gap**

### You've Already Invested in This Space

| Your Investment | What It Does | What Kyanos Adds |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------|
| Vote.org | Voter registration | We ensure voters find accurate info after they register |
| News for Democracy | Media ecosystem | We ensure AI surfaces accurate news about candidates |
| Run for Something | Candidate pipeline | We help those candidates compete in AI environments |

**Kyanos completes your portfolio. It's the AI layer on top of everything else.**

### What We're Offering

Not equity. Not an exit path.

**A chance to build permanent progressive infrastructure before the 2028 cycle.**

The platforms are not neutral. The algorithms are not fair. The President demands loyalty from tech CEOs.

We monitor the platforms. We detect the bias. We sound the alarm.

**Help us keep progressives visible in the AI era.**

---

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

"Thanasi, Investing In US was founded on a simple observation: technology is changing politics faster than politics is adapting.

That's exactly what we're seeing with AI. Political operatives are treating chatbots like a curiosity while conservatives are already optimizing for them.

You've already invested in voter registration, candidate pipelines, and media ecosystems. Kyanos is the missing layer—ensuring that when voters use AI to research candidates, they find accurate information.

And here's what I know about Investing In US: you're not looking for financial returns. You're looking for democratic returns. You want to build infrastructure that outlasts any single campaign or election cycle.

That's what Kyanos is. Trust-owned. Mission-locked. Built to serve progressives permanently.

The window is now. By 2028, the patterns will be set. The question is whether progressives have infrastructure in place—or whether we're playing catch-up on AI like we did with podcasts.

**Here's my ask:** I'd like you to bring this to Reid and Dmitri. If this resonates with you—if you see how it completes your portfolio—I want to give you everything you need to make the case internally.

What questions do you have? What would they need to see?"

## Key Numbers to Memorize

- **58.5%** of Google searches end without a click
- **4x** more persuasive than TV (Nature/Science 2025)
- **$1-10** cost per voter influenced (vs. $100-600 for TV)
- **45-60%** of voter queries answered by AI by 2028
- **$1M** ask, **$2.8M** revenue by 2028, **466** clients
- **200** free campaigns in 2026

## Anticipated Questions

1. **"Why can't campaigns do this themselves?"**
   - They can't. They don't have the infrastructure, the methodology, or the expertise. And they shouldn't have to—that's why infrastructure exists.

2. **"What if AI companies block your monitoring?"**
   - We're building bot detection countermeasures. We also have legal arguments (fair use, research purposes). And if they block us, that's evidence of the problem.

3. **"Why trust-owned instead of traditional VC?"**
   - Because the mission requires permanence. VC-backed companies get acquired. We need to exist for decades, serving campaigns regardless of who's in power.

4. **"Who's the CEO?"**
   - We're actively recruiting. Looking for someone with deep progressive foundation relationships and political tech experience. Happy to discuss candidates.

5. **"What if AI becomes less important?"**
   - Every trend line says otherwise. But even if AI plateaus, search optimization remains valuable. We're building for both.

6. **"How does this fit with what Investing In US already funds?"** (Thanasi-specific)
   - You fund voter registration (Vote.org), candidate pipelines (Run for Something), and media (News for Democracy). Kyanos is the AI layer that makes all of those investments more effective. When voters register, they research candidates—we ensure they find accurate info. When your candidates run, we help them compete in AI environments.

7. **"How do you think about youth civic engagement in this?"** (Given Thanasi's Civics Unplugged background)
   - Young voters are the most likely to use AI for information. They're digital natives who trust AI answers. If we don't optimize for how they research, we lose them. Also, training campaigns on Internet Presence Optimization is a form of civic education—we're teaching the ecosystem how to participate in the new information environment.

8. **"What's your theory of change for platform accountability?"** (Investing In US focuses on systemic change)
   - Individual campaign optimization creates aggregate pressure. When hundreds of campaigns are monitoring AI behavior and documenting patterns, we have evidence for public advocacy and policy. The Research Institute we're planning will publish findings that create accountability. We're building the infrastructure for watchdog journalism on AI.

9. **"How do you scale this to down-ballot races?"**
   - Self-service model with automated onboarding. Small campaigns enter their info, system configures monitoring automatically. Dashboard-first design means no human support needed for basic use. We're building for the long tail of democracy, not just marquee races.
