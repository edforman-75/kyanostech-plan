# Appendix D — Catalist Precedent

Catalist provides the structural model for Kyanos:

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Founded** | 2006 |
| **Structure** | Trust-owned LLC |
| **Initial funding** | $1M from George Soros; $4M+ from Tides Foundation |
| **Current status** | Serves virtually every major Democratic campaign |

## Relevance

Catalist proves the trust-owned model works for progressive political infrastructure:

- Mission-locked structure prevents hostile acquisition
- Foundation and major donor funding enabled launch
- Now self-sustaining through service revenue
- Became essential infrastructure for the entire progressive ecosystem

Kyanos follows the same playbook: grant-funded launch, mission-locked structure, path to self-sustainability through earned revenue.
