<div class="callout-title">The AI Abstention Trap</div>
<p><b>The Risk:</b> Progressive campaigns avoiding AI face systematic disadvantage against opponents using these technologies strategically.</p>

<p><b>The Reality:</b> 800 million users rely on ChatGPT weekly while 61% distrust AI — yet usage accelerates across all demographics (Appendix [X]).</p>

<p><b>The Consequence:</b> As 34% of Americans use AI for research, campaigns abstaining from optimization lose control over candidate representation in AI responses.</p>

<p><b>The Urgency:</b> With AI chatbots shifting political views in just five interactions, progressive campaigns must engage strategically or let conservatives dominate AI information space.</p>

<p><b>Bottom Line:</b> Ideological AI purity creates tactical blindness that risks Democratic losses when others shape AI-mediated political reality unchallenged.</p>
