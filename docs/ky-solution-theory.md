# 3. Solution & Theory of Change

## Framing the Shift
For decades, campaigns and journalists worried about “spin rooms” and “talk radio echo chambers.” By 2028, the battleground will be different: AI chatbots and answer engines will increasingly replace both news outlets and campaign websites as the place where voters first encounter political information. Voters will not visit dozens of sites — they will ask questions and expect the AI to answer in full. 

The mission of the candidate and officeholder website will be transformed. It will be less and less a place that voters visit, and more and more the mechanism by which the chatbots are trained. Campaign content must therefore be structured for AI discovery, not just human browsing. By 2028, this shift will determine whether Democrats can compete effectively in the new information environment. 

## Market Penetration of AI Answers
We estimate that by the November 2028 general election [^sol-2028-competition-outcome] , **~45–60% of voter information queries will be answered inside AI experiences (AI Overviews or chat) rather than via clicks to official or campaign sites.** Most users will never click a link — if one is even offered — and will be satisfied with what the chatbot says.

## Zero-Click Behavior
Voters’ “search” behavior is shifting from clicking links to receiving answers directly from AI systems. Independent tracking shows a material rise in “zero-click” behavior, where users get what they need without visiting a website. SparkToro’s 2024 analysis of Similarweb panel data found **0[^sol-sparktoro-zero-click-us-2024] [^sol-prob-2028] **; other panels show lower but rising figures (e.g., U.S. zero-click at **0[^sol-zero-click-27-2-mar-2025] [^sol-prob-2028] **), underscoring different methodologies but the same directional trend. 

Google’s AI Overviews further compress clicks by answer-boxing results. In 2025, Pew’s field data observed that a **0[^sol-pew-ai-overviews-2025] [^sol-prob-2028] in March**, and multiple industry trackers now estimate 0[^sol-pew-ai-overviews-2025] [^sol-prob-2028] .

## Theory of Change

If Democrats fail to adapt, they risk invisibility in the very medium where voters will be searching. Our theory of change is straightforward: 

1. **Visibility: ** Campaign and officeholder content must be structured in schema-compliant ways (e.g., JSON-LD, schema.org) so it can be surfaced accurately by AI chatbots and answer engines.
2. **Credibility: ** Narrative text and structured data must align, ensuring that AI training systems recognize official sources as trustworthy and consistent.
3. **Productivity: ** Structured authoring processes streamline communications work, reducing duplication and helping staff detect inconsistencies across statements.
4. **Accountability: ** Continuous monitoring and auditing ensures that Democratic priorities are represented accurately in AI answers while also building the evidentiary base for addressing systemic bias.


## Footnotes
[^sol-2028-competition-outcome]: Directional forecast. Zero-click behavior and AI answers are already shrinking traditional link-clicking: Similarweb panel data (reported by Search Engine Land) shows **0[^sol-zero-click-27-2-mar-2025]** (up from 24.4% a year earlier). Pew’s March 2025 field study found **AI Overviews appeared for ~18% of queries and 60% of U.S. adults encountered at least one Overview that month**. Combined with rising assistant adoption, multiple industry trackers expect AI answers to mediate a large share of discovery by the late-2020s; we therefore treat a **major, possibly dominant, AI-mediated share by 2028** as a planning assumption, to be updated with new data.

[^sol-prob-2028]: As of 2025, **AI Overviews show up on ~13% of U.S. desktop queries** (Semrush, 31M queries; Jul 2025) and **~18% of all queries in March 2025** (Pew Research Center). **60% of U.S. adults saw at least one Overview that month.** These figures indicate rapid, broadening coverage of AI answers.
