# Problem & Urgency

In 2024, Democrats underestimated the rise of podcasts as a persuasion medium. Conservative operatives and financiers systematically built an ecosystem of “low-trust but high-frequency” talk content that reached millions of voters week after week. Democrats were late to see this shift, and the asymmetry cost us narrative ground.

We now face a far more consequential inflection point: the rapid emergence of **AI chatbots and AI-assisted search as the default medium of political discovery**. These systems are no longer niche. They are already shaping how voters get answers to basic civic questions — and the pace of adoption is accelerating.

Voters’ “search” behavior is shifting from clicking links to receiving answers directly from AI systems. Independent tracking shows a material rise in “zero-click” behavior, where users get what they need without visiting a website. SparkToro’s 2024 analysis of Similarweb panel data found **58.5% of U.S. Google searches ended without a click**. Other trackers show lower but rising figures (e.g., **27.2% of U.S. Google searches zero-click as of March 2025**). Methodologies differ, but the trend is unmistakable: clicks are vanishing.

Google’s **AI Overviews** further compress clicks by answer-boxing results. In 2025, Pew’s field data observed that **a majority of users encountered at least one AI Overview in March 2025**, and multiple industry trackers now estimate Overviews appear on **roughly half of queries**.

We estimate that by the November 2028 general election, **~45–60% of voter information queries will be answered inside AI experiences (AI Overviews or chat) rather than via clicks to official or campaign sites**. Most users will never click a link, if one is even offered, and will be satisfied with what the chatbot says. The **mission of the candidate and officeholder website will be transformed**. It will be less and less a place that voters visit — and more and more the mechanism by which the chatbots are trained.

> **Footnote A — Technical Note:** *RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), RLAIF (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback), and Constitutional AI are different methods for aligning large language models. They control how systems rank, filter, and present answers — and thus directly shape what voters see.*  

> **Footnote B — Large Language Models (LLMs):** *LLMs are AI systems trained on massive text datasets to predict and generate language. They now underpin most advanced chatbots, including ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude.*  

> **Footnote C — Union Probability Estimate:** *Assumptions: AIO coverage grows from ~50–55% (2025) to 55–60% (2028); satisfaction rate ~60–70%; chatbot share of search events grows from ~5.6% desktop share (2025) to ~15–20% (2028). Computation: A = 0.58 × 0.65 ≈ 0.38; B = 0.18; assume 30% overlap → union ≈ 0.50 (50%). Range: 45–60%. These estimates will be locked down with BENCH pilot data in 2026–27.*
