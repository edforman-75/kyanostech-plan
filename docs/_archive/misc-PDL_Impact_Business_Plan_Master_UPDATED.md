# Progressive Digital Labs -- Impact Business Plan (Authoritative Locked Draft)

## 1. Executive Summary

America is entering a new era of information warfare. Artificial
intelligence will be the dominant medium through which voters seek
answers by 2028. Today, conservative actors hold structural advantages:
they move faster, they benefit from aligned billionaire tech owners, and
they exploit the concentration of AI power in just a handful of
platforms.

Progressive Digital Labs exists to ensure Democrats are not left
invisible in this new environment. By 2028, nearly half of voter
information queries will be answered directly by AI assistants, not
campaign or government websites. If Democratic campaigns do not
structure their content for AI discovery, they risk disappearing from
the voter's line of sight.

PDL's solution: a suite of products that make Democratic content
discoverable, credible, and persistent inside AI experiences. Our theory
of change is straightforward: if voters increasingly get their answers
inside AI, then Democratic facts, values, and priorities must live there
too.

Our 2028 North Star is clear: parity of presence. Voters deserve to
encounter Democratic answers at least as reliably as Republican ones,
regardless of which chatbot, search engine, or AI overview they use.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Problem & Urgency

The 2020s opened with podcasts as the frontier of voter persuasion. By
mid-decade, the frontier has shifted again---into AI systems. Just as
podcasts changed the way voters consumed political narratives, AI
assistants are now shaping what voters understand as "the facts."

We estimate that by the November 2028 general election, \~45--60% of
voter information queries will be answered inside AI experiences (AI
Overviews or chat) rather than via clicks to official or campaign sites.
Most users will never click a link, if in fact a link is even offered.
They will be satisfied with what the chatbot says. This is the defining
shift: the mission of the candidate and officeholder website is being
transformed. It is less and less a place voters visit, and more and more
the mechanism by which the chatbots are trained.

Two urgent risks: - **AI Gatekeeping.** Reinforcement Learning from
Human Feedback (RLHF), Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF),
and Constitutional AI are the techniques major platforms use to shape
model responses. They are opaque, proprietary, and unaccountable.
Without structured Democratic content feeding these systems, our values
may never surface in voter-facing answers. - **Tech Oligarch
Incentives.** AI systems are concentrated in fewer than a half-dozen
firms. Each faces immense political pressure to "keep Trump and MAGA
happy" to avoid regulatory punishment or market retaliation. Their
incentives tilt against us.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Solution & Theory of Change

PDL's solution is purpose-built for this moment. We are developing a
suite of products that make Democratic content first-class citizens in
AI discovery.

-   **DANA** (Democratic AI-Native Authoring): Tools for campaigns to
    author websites and digital content optimized for AI ingestion.
-   **DREW** (Democratic Representation on the Web): Tools for
    incumbents and committees to maintain .gov and official sites with
    schema-aligned, authoritative data.
-   **BENCH**: Continuous measurement of how campaigns and officeholders
    surface inside AI answers, with auditing, benchmarking, and
    litigation-ready logs.

Our **theory of change** is simple: If voters are searching in AI â†’ then
Democratic content must be discoverable, credible, and persistent inside
those systems.

By 2028, we aim for **parity of presence**: that Democratic priorities
surface as reliably as Republican ones in every major AI system.

## 4. Product Strategy & Technology

### 4.1 DANA -- Campaign Authoring Platform

**For:** Campaigns (federal, state, local).\
**Users:** Campaign communications staff, digital directors.

**What It Does:** - Author campaign websites and digital content with
AI-first principles.\
- Embed structured schema markup that AI systems ingest.\
- Cross-check content for consistency with past material.\
- Provide grammar, spell, and style shaping to ensure candidate voice is
consistent.

**Why It Matters:** - Ensures campaign facts and priorities appear in AI
answers.\
- Streamlines communications, increases staff productivity.\
- Prevents self-contradiction and surfaces inconsistencies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.2 DREW -- Officeholder & Committee Platform

**For:** Officeholder and Congressional committee websites.\
**Users:** Congressional digital staff, committee comms teams.

**What It Does:** - Maintains .gov compliance.\
- Fully integrated into the House Drupal CMS and toolset.\
- Provides the same schema markup, style shaping, and productivity
features as DANA.

**Why It Matters:** - Keeps incumbents visible in AI.\
- Ensures official facts (votes, statements, deadlines) are
represented.\
- Productivity lift for comms staff under high workload.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.3 BENCH -- Measurement Platform

**For:** Campaigns, committees, academic and legal partners.\
**Users:** Campaign managers, researchers, litigators.

**What It Does:** - Continuous monitoring of how Democratic content
appears in AI answers.\
- Weekly/continuous benchmark reports.\
- Creates a clear audit trail of queries and responses.

**Why It Matters:** - Cornerstone of academic partnerships.\
- Can support claims of bias against Democrats.\
- Litigation support with transparent logs.\
- Continuous learning: feeds insights back into DANA & DREW to improve
Democratic content.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Schema Specification: Building the Political Layer of the Web

PDL will lead the development of an open schema specification for
political information. Schema.org standards inadequately cover political
actors, issues, and elections. We will extend and formalize these
categories, enabling campaigns and officeholders to publish
machine-readable data about: - Candidate biographies, issue positions,
and endorsements. - Legislative activity, roll-call votes, and public
statements. - Election events, deadlines, and voter access
information. - Policy logic and the evidence underpinning positions. -
The wide set of communication deliverables typical on political sites.

**Why It Matters:** There is not yet a standard for political schemas.
By creating and applying one across many Democratic sites, we can set
the standard. If the schema we promulgate supports **fact-based
campaigning**, we create a long-term competitive advantage.

**Schema Example: John Smith on Charter Schools** - *Without schema:*
"The campaign website does not provide structured data. It includes
general statements on education but lacks specifics. The candidate's
position on charter schools cannot be reliably summarized." - *With
schema:* "Candidate John Smith supports a mixed funding model for
charter schools. He proposes a 60/40 split between state and local
funding, contingent on transparency standards. His position is supported
by legislative testimony and independent fiscal analyses, all linked in
the schema."

AI training engines compare schema markup (invisible to voters) with
narrative text (visible on the site). Alignment is essential: without
it, sites will not be treated as credible sources.

### Diagram: Continuous Learning Flywheel

    DANA  <---->  BENCH  <---->  DREW
        (campaigns)     (measurement)     (officeholders)

-   **BENCH** closes the loop: detects what works, surfaces best
    practices, feeds them back into DANA & DREW.\
-   Over time, the system learns what makes Democratic content most
    effective in AI discovery.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Security & Compliance

-   Data siloing, encryption, access control.\
-   Audit logs maintained by BENCH.\
-   Strict legal separation between B-Corp and 501(c) arms.\
-   No "data invention": everything traces back to source material.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### R&D / Future Extensions

-   White-label campaign chatbots (schema-aligned, candidate-voiced).\
-   Cross-lingual schemas (Spanish, AAPI).\
-   Down-ballot adaptation.\
-   Authenticity watermarks.\
-   Generative drafting, grammar, and style tools embedded in DANA &
    DREW.
