# Financial Plan

<!-- cross-ref: Financial_Plan -->

PDLâ€™s financial plan is designed with discipline: modest early pilots, careful scaling, and a break-even target in 2028. We raise $5M in staged capital (Seed, Series A, Convertible), allocate efficiently across R&D, compliance, go-to-market, and infrastructure, and plan for sensitivity to adoption scenarios.  

## Capital Plan  

- **$0.5M Seed (Q4 2025):** funds assumption validation, network building, prototypes, and initial partner development.  
- **$2.5M Series A (early 2026):** supports pilot deployments, early Senate/House/Governor races, and standing up core engineering and sales teams.  
- **$2.0M Convertible Debt (late 2027):** bridges into the 2028 cycle, enabling scale-up for presidential and full-cycle adoption.  

Capital efficiency is paramount: we model a minimum $0.5M reserve buffer at all times to allow wind-down or bridge options.  

## Revenue & Expense Projections (2025â€“2028)  

| Year | Revenue ($M) | Expense ($M) | Cash Inflow ($M) | Cash Outflow ($M) | EOY Cash Balance ($M) |
|------|--------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| 2025 | 0.0 | 0.8 (validation, prototypes, legal) | 0.5 Seed | -0.8 | -0.3 |
| 2026 | 0.3 | 2.8 | 2.5 Series A | -2.8 | -0.6 + 2.5 = 1.9 |
| 2027 | 0.6 | 3.5 | 2.0 Convertible | -3.5 | 0.4 + 2.0 = 2.4 |
| 2028 | 4.2 | 3.7 | â€” | -3.7 | 2.9 + 4.2 - 3.7 = 3.4 |

*Note: 2025 expenses limited to assumption validation, prototypes, and network building (no deployments). First real revenues in 2026.*  

## Sensitivity Analysis (2028 Scenarios)

To demonstrate robustness, we model low, base, and high adoption scenarios for 2028.  

| Category            | Low Case ($M / %) | Base Case ($M / %) | High Case ($M / %) |
|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Revenue**         | 3.2              | 4.2               | 5.3               |
| **R&D**             | 1.2 / 38%        | 1.5 / 36%         | 1.8 / 34%         |
| **Compliance/Legal**| 0.4 / 13%        | 0.5 / 12%         | 0.6 / 11%         |
| **Go-to-Market**    | 1.0 / 31%        | 1.2 / 29%         | 1.4 / 27%         |
| **Infrastructure**  | 0.4 / 13%        | 0.5 / 12%         | 0.6 / 11%         |
| **Total Expenses**  | 3.0              | 3.7               | 4.4               |
| **EOY Cash Balance**| ~0.6             | ~0.5              | ~0.8              |

Interpretation:  
- **Low Case (3.2M revenue):** We trim expenses, still maintain ~$0.6M cushion.  
- **Base Case (4.2M revenue):** Neutral cash flow, ~$0.5M buffer.  
- **High Case (5.3M revenue):** Upside with ~$0.8M cushion, reinforcing sustainability.  

## Break-Even and Cyclicality  

- Break-even is explicitly targeted for 2028 (no profit, but no losses).  
- Revenues are highly cyclical: Senate, House, Governor, and Presidential races drive spikes in even years; officeholder/committee business provides baseline in odd years.  
- Expense planning assumes steady permanent headcount and contractors for cycle peaks, preventing disruptive layoffs.  

## CAC and LTV  

- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):** Includes sales, marketing, support, and onboarding. For competitive races, CAC is modeled at ~$6â€“15K; for officeholders/committees, ~$3â€“5K.  
- **LTV (Lifetime Value):** Campaigns last 1â€“2 years; officeholders/committees longer. LTV ranges from $25â€“200K depending on tier.  
- Ratios: CAC/LTV remain healthy (>5:1 even in conservative scenarios), comparable to SaaS benchmarks.  

## Methodology Notes  

- **Campaign counts Ã— ARPU** drive revenue (see Market & Financial Opportunity).  
- Expenses scale with headcount (validated against D.C. benchmarks), legal/compliance guardrails, and infrastructure (~12% of revenue by 2028).  
- Sensitivity assumes adoption rates vary but price points hold; adjustment levers are expense timing, contractor reliance, and deferral of non-critical features.
