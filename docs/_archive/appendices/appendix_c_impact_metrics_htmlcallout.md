# Appendix C: Impact Metrics Methodology

## Executive Summary

We measure success through three core Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):  

1. **Campaigns Served** – baseline 0, goal 300 by 2028.  
2. **Quality Improvement Index (QII)** – measures coverage, accuracy, clarity, and schema compliance.  
3. **Replaced Media Spend %** – percentage of campaign media spend shifted to PDL-optimized presence.  

This appendix explains the methodologies, data sources, and validation processes behind these metrics to ensure transparency and investor confidence.

## 1. Campaigns Served

**Definition:**  
A “served campaign” is defined as any Democratic campaign, committee, or officeholder that has engaged with PDL’s platform for at least one billing cycle or equivalent service agreement.  

**Measurement Method:**  
- Campaign onboarding tracked in CRM.  
- Service verification via VAR partner reports.  
- Usage confirmation through analytics logs.  

**Verification:**  
Cross-checked against [FEC campaign filings](https://www.fec.gov/data/) and [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/) election universe data to avoid double counting.[^1]

## 2. Quality Improvement Index (QII)

**Components:**  
- **Coverage:** Share of candidate facts covered.  
- **Accuracy:** Fact-check compliance rate.  
- **Clarity:** Reading level and style audits.  
- **Schema Compliance:** Adherence to structured data standards.  

**Measurement Method:**  
- Baseline audits using manual scoring and automated schema validators.  
- Peer-reviewed accuracy checks against campaign-approved sources.  
- Automated monitoring of structured data using [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) validators.[^2]  

**Reporting Cadence:** Quarterly reporting with aggregated scores across campaigns.

## 3. Replaced Media Spend %

**Definition:**  
The portion of campaign media spend redirected from traditional advertising (TV, radio, direct mail) to PDL-enabled digital optimization.  

**Calculation:**  
\[ Replaced\ Media\ Spend\ % = \frac{Spend\ via\ PDL}{Baseline\ Media\ Spend} \times 100 \]  

**Validation:**  
- Pilot campaign budgets compared to historical norms.  
- Benchmarked against [OpenSecrets media spending data](https://www.opensecrets.org/).[^3]  
- Cross-referenced with Higher Ground Labs adoption studies.[^4]

## Data Collection & Verification

- **CRM Integration:** Automated tracking of campaigns served.  
- **Analytics Dashboards:** Usage logs, schema audit results.  
- **Partner Reporting:** VAR partners required to certify campaign service counts quarterly.  
- **Third-Party Verification:** Independent audits of schema compliance and spend replacement.  

---

## Limitations & Risks

- **Attribution Complexity:** Some digital optimization effects may overlap with campaign-led media efforts.  
- **Data Lag:** Campaign finance data (FEC, OpenSecrets) often released with delays.  
- **Under-Reporting Risk:** Campaigns may not disclose all replaced spend, especially in down-ballot races.
