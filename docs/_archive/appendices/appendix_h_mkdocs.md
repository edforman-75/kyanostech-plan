Maya looks up from her homework. "Grandpa, I don't get it. All my research shows the Democrats were supposed to win in 2028. But President Richardson got re-elected anyway. How could they all be so wrong?"

**Part II: The Georgetown Conspiracy (5:30-11:45)**  
- James Wellington reveals President Richardson's obsession with "information war"
- The private dinner where democracy was compromised
- Marcus Steinberg's justification for the manipulation

**Part III: Project Compass (11:45-16:20)**
- Alex Chen exposes the three-phase technical implementation
- How AI responses were subtly biased without changing facts
- The gradual deployment strategy that avoided detection

**Part IV: The Aftermath (16:20-20:14)**

<h4 style="color: #27ae60; margin-top: 0;">Key Strategic Insights</h4>
<p style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">This fictional scenario demonstrates vulnerabilities in AI-mediated information systems that could theoretically compromise democratic processes through:</p>
<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
<li>Subtle bias introduction rather than outright factual manipulation</li>
<li>Gradual implementation to avoid detection by bias monitoring systems</li>
<li>Targeting swing demographics and contested topics for maximum electoral impact</li>
<li>Exploiting public trust in AI objectivity and neutrality</li>
</ul>
