# Progressive Digital Labs Impact Business Plan (Master)

# Executive Summary

[Locked content previously written]

## The Four-Year Ramp (2025–2028)
- **2025**: Quiet relationship-building and assumption validation.
- **2026**: Early concessions, credibility pilots, and case studies with gubernatorial and House races.
- **2027**: Expansion into Senate campaigns and officeholders/committees; recurring base revenue begins.
- **2028**: Scaled dominance — 300+ campaigns served via PAC/consultant partnerships, visibility dashboards, and platform maturity.


# Go-to-Market Strategy

Progressive Digital Labs’ go-to-market approach is designed to maximize adoption in a cyclical campaign market, balancing early credibility with scalable growth. The model prioritizes partnerships, high-impact races, and time-bound concessions to secure beachheads in 2026 and set up rapid expansion for 2028.

## Channel Strategy
- **Direct Engagement (25%)**: Reserved for top-tier campaigns where credibility is most valuable (early Senate, House, and gubernatorial campaigns).
- **Partnership Distribution (75%)**: Core strategy. Website developers, digital consultants, and PACs provide reach across hundreds of campaigns with far lower CAC.
- **Limited CMS Support**: Integration with **WordPress, NGP VAN, NationBuilder, and Run!** — the dominant CMS platforms used in Democratic campaigns. This ensures efficient adoption without custom connectors for every vendor.

**Responsibility:** GTM execution is led by the **Chief Commercial & Impact Officer**, responsible for PAC and union partnerships, CMS relationships (WordPress, NGP VAN, NationBuilder, Run!), and ensuring adoption translates directly into measurable Democratic impact.

## Foundational Relationship-Building (2025–2026)
- **2025 (Seed Phase)**:
  - No deployments in this year.
  - The Chief Commercial & Impact Officer takes direct responsibility for cultivating discreet relationships with PACs, unions, digital consultants, CMS vendors, and campaign managers.
  - Conduct assumption-testing interviews with 30–50 stakeholders to validate demand, adoption barriers, and pricing expectations.
  - Activities are kept deliberately below the radar — focused on listening, mapping networks, and preparing targeted entry in 2026, not public visibility.

- **2026 (First Pilots)**:
  - Leverage these early contacts to secure initial gubernatorial and competitive House campaigns.
  - Begin PAC co-funding discussions with organizations that supported interviews in 2025.
  - Offer deep discounts and manual services as a one-time credibility investment to secure flagship pilot accounts.

## 2026 — Early Validation & Concessions
- **Targets**: Competitive gubernatorial races (36 on the ballot; priority in battleground states), and a focused set of highly competitive or well-funded House races.
- **Tactics**:
  - Deep discounts and manual service support to secure credibility even where automation is incomplete.
  - PAC and Association Partnerships: Work with labor PACs (e.g., SEIU COPE) and membership PACs (e.g., EMILY’s List) to subsidize early campaigns.
- **Goal**: 10–15 marquee adoptions by cycle end; establish credibility, case studies, and reference customers.

## 2027 — Expansion & Officeholder Base
- **Targets**:
  - Growth in Senate campaigns entering early for 2028.
  - Expansion into House committees and officeholders, leveraging standardized CMS (.gov sites).
- **Tactics**:
  - Develop partner certification programs to enable scaled adoption.
  - Build early officeholder/committee revenue for recurring base.
  - Shift pricing closer to 2028 levels as features mature; reduce reliance on concessions.
- **Goal**: 40–50 active accounts (mix of campaigns + committees). Proof of scalability and partner-led growth.

## 2028 — Full-Scale Presidential & Federal Cycle
- **Targets**:
  - Presidential campaigns (primary and general).
  - All competitive Senate and governor races.
  - Around 30 competitive House races plus leadership/committee officeholders.
- **Tactics**:
  - National PAC/Union Partnerships: Integrate AI optimization funding into bundled candidate support packages.
  - Partner-Led Implementation: Majority of new campaigns acquired through certified consultants and developers.
  - Visibility Dashboarding: Deliver real-time campaign visibility benchmarks as a differentiator.
- **Goal**: 300+ campaigns and officeholders, demonstrating dominance of AI optimization for Democratic campaigns.

## Strategic Partnerships with Direct-Contribution Political Organizations
- **PAC-Driven Distribution**:
  - Labor unions (e.g., SEIU COPE) can bulk-fund optimization across dozens of candidates.
  - Professional PACs (e.g., EMILY’s List) can integrate our services into their candidate support offerings.
- **Proof of Value**: Success requires documenting how AI optimization improves campaign visibility and electoral outcomes, making it a natural addition to PAC-funded candidate packages.
- **Leverage Multiplier**: Each partnership can extend reach across dozens of campaigns, reducing CAC and embedding us in Democratic infrastructure.

# Team & Governance

Progressive Digital Labs upholds dual accountability: commitment to **mission**—advancing Democratic values and electoral integrity—and stewardship toward **investors**, ensuring capital discipline and long-term viability.  

<!-- cross-ref map

## Why a B-Corp Instead of a PAC  
We chose a **B-Corp structure** rather than a PAC because it allows us to attract investment capital with both mission and financial upside:  
- **Tax Treatment**: Losses are deductible against other investment income, unlike contributions to PACs which are after-tax[^1].  
- **Potential Upside**: If we succeed, there is a possibility of return of capital and even positive return on capital.  
- **Mission Lock**: The B-Corp structure legally binds the company to pursue social good alongside profit, aligning impact investors with electoral outcomes[^2].  

This hybrid model (with an affiliated 501(c) arm for complementary nonprofit activities) creates optionality: if one pathway becomes constrained, another provides flexibility.  

## Legal Counsel & Organizational Separation  
To protect both our for-profit and nonprofit arms, we maintain a **part-time General Counsel** with deep expertise in nonprofit election law and corporate governance. This counsel is essential for:  
- **Maintaining separation** between the B-Corp and the affiliated 501(c)(3) nonprofit; ensuring no crossover of activities or perceptions of coordination that could jeopardize tax-exempt status[^3].  
- **Advising on permissible activities**, particularly preventing inadvertent campaign intervention by the nonprofit arm. 501(c)(3) organizations are strictly prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in political campaigns, and violations can lead to loss of tax-exempt status[^4].  
- Overseeing **contract review, contribution structures, and compliance safeguards**, ensuring all materials, partnerships, and expenditures are properly vetted. The GC also advises the board and periodically attends meetings to preempt legal risk[^5].  

By investing in specialized counsel from the start, we mitigate legal exposure and document the rigor of our separation strategy, reinforcing both trust and regulatory resilience.  

## Founding Officers  
- **Chief Executive Officer (CEO)** — Leading vision, investor relations, and strategic oversight. The CEO is the **only officer with a board seat**.  
- **Chief Technology Officer (CTO)** — Oversees product innovation, engineering, and integrations with Democratic-aligned CMS platforms.  
- **Chief Commercial & Impact Officer (Founding Officer)** — Stewards go-to-market execution, PAC and union partnerships, CMS distribution, and translates adoption into measurable **Democratic** impact while balancing commercial growth and mission fidelity.  

This team combines technical expertise, campaign credibility, and commercial execution capacity.  

## Board Composition  
The board is intentionally structured with an odd number of seats to ensure balanced governance:  
- Founding CEO (only officer on board)  
- **1–2 impact investor representatives** (capital rigor)  
- **1–2 movement leaders** (fidelity to progressive values)  
- **1 independent technologist** (product oversight)  
- **1 partner representative** (ensuring alignment with distribution, CMS, and integration partners)  

A five- or seven-member board creates a cross-section of accountability, preventing any single constituency from dominating.  

## Compensation Philosophy  
To attract highly capable, mission-minded talent, compensation is competitive with 85th percentile rates of DC tech/policy professionals[^6]. We include:  
- **Base salaries** with built-in annual raises (~3%) plus inflation adjustment (~2%).  
- **Equity or performance incentives** for foundational staff.  
- A **mission premium** expectation—that team members prioritize impact and Democratic return over speculative upside.  

This structure ensures stability, retention, and appeal to both impact-oriented professionals and experienced campaign technologists.
