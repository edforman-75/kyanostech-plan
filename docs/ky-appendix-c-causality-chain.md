# Appendix C — Causality Chain Methodology

Our methodology traces AI errors to their root causes and prescribes specific fixes:

1. **Observe:** What does the AI surface say?
2. **Trace:** Where did it get that information?
3. **Diagnose:** What's the root cause of the error?
4. **Prescribe:** Specific fix for the source, not the symptom

**Key Principle:** Only recommend actions the campaign can take. No "shoulda/woulda."

We focus on what campaigns can change—their website structure, schema markup, content clarity—not on factors outside their control.
