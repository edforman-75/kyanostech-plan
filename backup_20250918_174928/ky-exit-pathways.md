# Exit & Legacy

KyanosTech is structured to serve a singular mission: ensuring Democratic campaigns are visible, credible, and competitive in the AI-mediated information era. Our *North Star* is the 2028 election cycle. Every investment decision, partnership, and technology roadmap is aligned toward delivering impact at that moment of maximum national consequence.

## Exit Optionality

We do not frame this as a “unicorn” growth story. Instead, we highlight credible, mission-aligned exit pathways:

- **Acquisition by strategic buyer**: KyanosTech’s schema standards, structured data tools, and bias-auditing capabilities are natural extensions for platforms like NGP VAN, DSPolitical, NationBuilder/WordPress political practices, prominent Democratic technology consulting firms, or civic SaaS providers that already serve Democratic campaigns.  
- **Hybrid spinout**: Portions of KyanosTech’s work may migrate into a 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) nonprofit entity after 2028, ensuring sustainability of the schema standard and audit practices even if market conditions change.  
- **Profitable independent growth**: If revenue stability is achieved, KyanosTech can continue as a mission-driven B Corp, expanding into state, local, and issue-based campaigns, providing long-term sustainability while preserving independence.

## Mission-Centered Legacy

Regardless of exit path, core assets remain committed to the Democratic ecosystem:

- The **political schema specification** becomes a durable infrastructure layer.  
- The **bias-auditing methodology** provides an evidence base for accountability.  
- The **integration network** of consultants, PACs, and CMS providers ensures continuity.  

This ensures that KyanosTech’s contribution outlives any one campaign cycle or ownership structure.

## Investor Lens

For investors, the structure offers unique benefits:

- **Downside protection**: Unlike PAC contributions, B Corp investments allow for **tax-deductible losses** if KyanosTech does not succeed.  
- **Upside participation**: If KyanosTech proves financially sustainable, investors can see **capital recovery and moderate returns** while also achieving high-leverage impact.  
- **Risk mitigation**: Conservative financial planning, explicit sensitivity modeling, and a minimum reserve buffer of $0.5M protect against sudden shocks.

**Takeaway:**  
KyanosTech exists to ensure Democrats are represented fairly in the age of AI-mediated information. Its legacy will be not only the campaigns it serves directly, but the standards, practices, and infrastructure it leaves embedded in the Democratic ecosystem — durable assets that persist well beyond 2028.
