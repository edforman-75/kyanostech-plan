# Problem & Urgency

In 2024, Democrats underestimated the rise of podcasts [^]    as a persuasion medium. Conservative operatives and financiers systematically built [^]   an ecosystem  of “low-trust but high-frequency” talk content that reached millions of voters week after week. Democrats were late to see this shift [^]   , and the asymmetry cost us narrative ground.

We now face a far more consequential inflection point: the rapid emergence of **AI chatbots and AI-assisted search [^]  as the default medium of political discovery ** . These systems are no longer niche. They are already shaping how voters get answers to basic civic questions — and the pace of adoption is accelerating.

Voters’ “search” behavior is shifting  from clicking links to receiving answers directly from AI systems. Search Engine Land reported that **27.2% of U.S. searches in March 2025 ended without a click [^]  , up from 24.4% the year before**.

Google’s **AI Overviews further compress clicks** by answer-boxing results. **Pew Research (July 2025) [^]  found that about 18%  of all queries in March 2025 generated an AI Overview, while 60% of U.S. adults encountered at least one Overview during the month**. **Semrush’s July 2025 study [^]  reported a similar figure  of 13.14% query coverage**.

The trend is unmistakable: voters are increasingly satisfied  with what the AI system says, never clicking through to official or campaign websites. The traditional model of persuasion through web links is eroding, while AI answer surfaces are becoming the new battleground.


!!! note "The AI Abstention Trap"

    **The Risk:** Data show progressives  report higher concern about AI’s societal harms than conservatives; this heightened suspicion may leave progressives hesitant to implement AI-optimizing features.

    **The Reality:** **800 million users [^]   ** rely on ChatGPT weekly while **61% distrust AI**—yet usage accelerates across demographics (see Appendix).

    **The Consequence:** **34% of Americans [^]   ** use AI for research; abstaining cedes control over how candidates are represented in AI answers.

    **The Urgency:** Chatbot interactions can shift political views within a handful of exchanges; failing to engage concedes the terrain.

    **Bottom line:** Ideological purity becomes tactical blindness when others shape AI-mediated reality unchallenged.

We estimate that by the November 2028 general election, **~45–60%   of voter information queries will be answered inside AI experiences (AI Overviews or chat) rather than via clicks to official or campaign sites**. Most users will never click a link , if one is even offered, and will be satisfied with what the chatbot says. The **mission of the candidate and officeholder website will be transformed**. It will be less and less a place that voters visit — and more and more the mechanism by which the chatbots are trained.
