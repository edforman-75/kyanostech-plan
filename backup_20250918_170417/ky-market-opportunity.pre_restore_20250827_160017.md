# Market & Financial Opportunity

## 1. Urgency of Digital Discovery
By 2026–2028, it’s projected that **over half of all voter interactions**—from research to decision-making—will occur via **AI-mediated interfaces and structured discovery**, rather than traditional media. This behavioral shift is mirrored in campaign strategy: by August 2024, digital political ad spend had already reached **$619M**, with **$1.35B for the full cycle**, highlighting how campaigns are reallocating resources toward online channels to reach voters where discovery is increasingly taking place **and where voters look for further information**[^fn-mo-method-1].
- **Technology Budget Expansion:** Campaigns are increasingly investing in digital infrastructure (web platforms, analytics, structured data tools).  
- **Cyclical Uptake:** We expect SOM-driven ARR to peak in 2028, trough slightly in off-years, but remain supported through recurring officeholder/committee contracts, creating sustainable revenue flows across cycles.

[^fn-mo-method-1]: <strong>Ad Spend as Context—not Inclusion</strong> — Digital ad figures are used only to demonstrate the ongoing migration of campaign effort toward online voter reach and discovery; they are <em>not</em> included in TAM.

[^fn-mo-method-2]: <strong>Digital-Tech Share Benchmark (TAM)</strong> — Context from total political advertising (≈ $12B in 2024) with ~28% digital share (see items below); non-media tech budgets conservatively estimated at 3–5% of campaign spend.

[^fn-mo-method-3]: <strong>Proportional Allocation (SAM)</strong> — SAM is a conservative subset of TAM, limited to structured-data/AI-discovery tooling and constrained by adoption readiness.

[^fn-mo-method-4]: <strong>SOM Penetration</strong> — SOM reflects early-stage SaaS adoption patterns and limited CMS integrations (attainable ≈ $30–50M), with peak 2028 cycle and off-year troughs cushioned by officeholder/committee renewals.
