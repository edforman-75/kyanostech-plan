# Business Model & Unit Economics

We structure the business model using the Strategyzer Business Model Canvas (BMC)[^fn-bm-strategyzer].  
All elements below are initial assumptions; during the SEED phase, we will conduct further research, expert interviews, and partner validation to substantiate the model.

---

## 1. Customer Segments
- Democratic campaigns (Presidential, Senate, House).  
- Democratic committees (DNC, DSCC, DCCC, state parties).  
- Officeholder committees (incumbent Members of Congress).  
- Independent-aligned campaigns and committees (case-by-case).  

---

## 2. Value Propositions
- **Visibility in AI search:** Ensures Democratic facts, values, and positions are discoverable in AI assistants.  
- **Compliance & security:** Meets .gov and FEC requirements.  
- **Productivity:** Reduces staff time via structured authoring, grammar/style support.  
- **Accountability:** Continuous benchmarking/audit trail supports litigation, press, and public trust.  

---

## 3. Channels
- Direct sales to national committees and large campaigns.  
- Partnerships with Democratic digital agencies.  
- Limited CMS support (WordPress, Drupal/GovCMS) for distribution.  
See Appendix E: CMS Landscape Briefing for detail on CMS platforms and their role in campaign infrastructure.
- SEED phase pilots to build reference customers.  

---

## 4. Customer Relationships
- White-glove onboarding (early years).  
- Transition to scalable SaaS self-service by 2027–2028.  
- Ongoing customer success + training for campaign staff.  

---

## 5. Revenue Streams
- SaaS subscription tiers:  
  - **AGON** (campaign) – $1,500–$3,000/month depending on race size.  
  - **POLIS** (officeholder) – $1,000–$2,000/month.  
- Early services revenue (schema setup, training, audits).  
- Custom pilots (presidential campaigns, congressional committees).  

### Comparables
| Platform      | Typical Pricing            |
|---------------|----------------------------|

## 6. Key Resources
- Proprietary schema library and AI benchmarking system.  
- Engineering team (schema, AI/ML, integrations).  
- Policy/legal advisors for compliance.  
- Partnerships with campaign committees and agencies.  

---

## 7. Key Activities
- Continuous schema development and updates.  
- Benchmark testing and reporting.  
- Customer onboarding + training.  
- Security and compliance audits.  

---

## 8. Key Partnerships
- Democratic committees (DNC, DSCC, DCCC).  
- Academic institutions (methodology, bias research).  
- Agencies providing campaign digital services.  
- CMS providers (WordPress, Drupal/GovCMS).  

---

## 9. Cost Structure
- Heavy R&D in early years (schema, SCOPE platform, AI testing).  
- Services staff (onboarding, setup) in 2025–2026.  
- Transition to SaaS-dominant margins (>70%) by 2028. [^fn-bm-margins-2028]  
- Estimated ARR by 2028: **~$4. [^fn-bm-arr-2028]2M**, with durable SaaS retention.  

Given significant operating, product development, and customer acquisition costs, achieving cash-flow break-even in 2028 depends on hitting both our revenue targets and our gross-margin goals.
