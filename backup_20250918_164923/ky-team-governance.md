## Why a B-Corp Instead of a PAC  
We chose a **B-Corp structure** rather than a PAC because it allows us to attract investment capital with both mission and financial upside:  
- **Tax Treatment**: Losses are deductible against other investment income, unlike contributions to PACs which are after-tax[^1].  
- **Potential Upside**: If we succeed, there is a possibility of return of capital and even positive return on capital.  
- **Mission Lock**: The B-Corp structure legally binds the company to pursue social good alongside profit, aligning impact investors with electoral outcomes[^2].  

This hybrid model (with an affiliated 501(c) arm for complementary nonprofit activities) creates optionality: if one pathway becomes constrained, another provides flexibility.  

## Legal Counsel & Organizational Separation  
To protect both our for-profit and nonprofit arms, we maintain a **part-time General Counsel** with deep expertise in nonprofit election law and corporate governance. This counsel is essential for:  
- **Maintaining separation** between the B-Corp and the affiliated 501(c)(3) nonprofit; ensuring no crossover of activities or perceptions of coordination that could jeopardize tax-exempt status[^3].  
- **Advising on permissible activities**, particularly preventing inadvertent campaign intervention by the nonprofit arm. 501(c)(3) organizations are strictly prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in political campaigns, and violations can lead to loss of tax-exempt status[^4].  
  - Overseeing **contract review, contribution structures, and compliance safeguards**, ensuring all materials, partnerships, and expenditures are properly vetted. The GC also advises the board and periodically attends meetings to preempt legal risk[^5].  

By investing in specialized counsel from the start, we mitigate legal exposure and document the rigor of our separation strategy, reinforcing both trust and regulatory resilience.  

## Founding Officers  
- **Chief Executive Officer (CEO)** — Leading vision, investor relations, and strategic oversight. The CEO is the **only officer with a board seat**.  
- **Chief Technology Officer (CTO)** — Oversees product innovation, engineering, and integrations with Democratic-aligned CMS platforms.  
- **Chief Commercial & Impact Officer (Founding Officer)** — Stewards go-to-market execution, PAC and union partnerships, CMS distribution, and translates adoption into measurable **Democratic** impact while balancing commercial growth and mission fidelity.  

This team combines technical expertise, campaign credibility, and commercial execution capacity.  

## Board Composition  
The board is intentionally structured with an odd number of seats to ensure balanced governance:  
- Founding CEO (only officer on board)  
- **1–2 impact investor representatives** (capital rigor)  
- **1–2 movement leaders** (fidelity to progressive values)  
- **1 independent technologist** (product oversight)  
- **1 partner representative** (ensuring alignment with distribution, CMS, and integration partners)  

A five- or seven-member board creates a cross-section of accountability, preventing any single constituency from dominating.  

## Compensation Philosophy  
To attract highly capable, mission-minded talent, compensation is competitive with 85th percentile rates of DC tech/policy professionals[^6]. We include:  
- **Base salaries** with built-in annual raises (~3%) plus inflation adjustment (~2%).  
- **Equity or performance incentives** for foundational staff.  
  - A **mission premium** expectation—that team members prioritize impact and Democratic return over speculative upside.  

This structure ensures stability, retention, and appeal to both impact-oriented professionals and experienced campaign technologists.
