  title: Union probability estimate used here
  body: 'Assumptions: AI Overview coverage grows from ~50–55% (2025) to 55–60% (2028);
    satisfaction rate ~60–70%; chatbot share of search events grows from ~5.6% desktop
    share (2025) to ~15–20% (2028). Computation: A = 0.58 × 0.65 ≈ 0.38; B = 0.18;
    assume 30% overlap → union ≈ 0.50 (50%). Range: 45–60%. These estimates will be
    refined with SCOPE pilot data in 2026–27.'
